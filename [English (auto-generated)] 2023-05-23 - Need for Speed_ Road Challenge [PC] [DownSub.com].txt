welcome

I see that

running switch no one that showed up yet

[Music]

I have got my headphones

that I can't candy cane

but I will continue

someone suggested that I should

basically retry

all the races and people

go up sounds like a good idea

I will do that

it'd be nice but some kind of business

identification that big car is damaged

because it's kind of uneven here

I'll sell me in here so it looks like

they carry the damage but it's apparent

enough

and let's try this that was half of my

money

just to do this race

and this was a regular

place I think that's enough yeah

three two one go

so let's see

don't remember

I don't think I have a very common I'm

just gonna try this

but I do have a better frame rate

and it's a better spots

okay

I have so much skills

[Music]

Victor

[Music]

I'm sorry about that

[Music]

but I have a race to him

well I was close to the one

yeah but so far

fine

shark Corners that we have lead any car

disappear

when this hill

[Music]

there's a certain random distance in the

game

[Music]

these lines on the roads are separate

from their shoulder minimum actually

apart after her

and I don't remember this but this thing

the dash line is actually individual

objects

thank you

yeah obvious that don't think much

performance across the eye

just two trials

that take shows up

and they're quite spaced out

[Music]

It's the final lap you're left okay

didn't really pay attention

now

[Music]

three if I can't

just around this car

[Music]

any speeding services and there's this

jump again

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

on the inside of that corner

[Music]

there we go

[Music]

and the driver was

named Bill for girls can't collectors

and all

the last place with the furthest away

from gold

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

and then it says

thank you

[Applause]

Morgan is a threat okay let's repair the

car

and continue the second

[Applause]

and now

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

town

[Music]

I would find it

interesting should I combined the first

time

I guess

if there aren't any snow assets but

these

for the buildings yes and there's a

no less assets for the other section

30 sections so

this is going to be really difficult to

do that hello kitten welcome

happy place but it's fine you have to

pick the coming girl

huh

he's entered

[Music]

I know it's it's raminos it's fine I

mean I would rather we still before

Emerald but

it's nice it's not it's up again

I should keep the lead after 20.

a person's rather catch first place

[Music]

sorry I

apparently touched it huh

[Music]

and it happened

yeah I'm redoing one of the previous

races where I didn't get gold

to get girls and to get some more money

I'm not gonna think any more money

yeah I thought I would make you the

camera before everyone comes in that's

your best lap you placed first

that's that sign didn't die wait ramaran

got lost I must be in the left

how's it going

East tracks

three two one go

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

it's fine

this is a person

it is of course

a bit lonely if no one shows up and

stuck on the screen nothing's fine

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

all right

and I hope it works out for you so you

can use it

do you think I capture tambia be tricky

depending on what you have

the one I'm using 20 is a bit tricky to

get too hard

if you're using the

capturing the video from the capture

window of the software is quite reliable

but the quality is so bad

and

taking the input or the outputs

from the capture card

does give a much better picture but

getting the audio server is a bit tricky

I think I figured out how to do it so

[Music]

well I think it's about to happen

[Music]

[Music]

final laptop

[Music]

[Music]

last night

[Music]

same underwear as lastly

thanks you're welcome

[Music]

that's worthy sporty anyway

we want to see this spot

but it's still underwear

[Music]

so cute

[Music]

what

upside down

yeah she's just taking a bit easy there

at least then I must leave so

[Music]

[Music]

let's see the escapes

[Music]

well close to the wall there

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

they're paying the car continue

we should make a remake of this game

more tracks

so when

they shouldn't do like

[Music]

so they should remake these tracks as

closely as possible

um

[Music]

but it should look cute and have higher

on account

[Music]

and then they shoot left you and then

they should make the uh

no effect

that should be a toggle

[Music]

in addition to weather in life

so every track can be a snow track

will it make sense for this character

well like it's not

but it would be an interesting part

because if they can take this outside

which is snowing for the inside which is

not snowing

uh this car is so easy Morgan is it up

again

[Music]

we need to take some drastic measures

it's fine like that it's not smooth

again

going for girl was trying to get to the

first place

[Music]

I'll thank you for please

[Music]

they're so cute

and thank you

I actually see

I do want to be king

why why are you praise him he wanted a

fast fight

[Music]

[Music]

that's of course I'm crushing anything

but

it did a lot especially since it's the

final lap

[Music]

so it's not

it's not a long race

yeah but basically because some there

are two tracks

which have a snow variant and a nuts no

Valiant

not snowmanian

but it's my basic idea was to have you

should also be able to drive on this

snow variant without snow and the

right without snow with snow

it's there are two different layouts

[Music]

[Music]

and I guess the name is one of the

tracks is only one of the tracks

actually have snow in the name right

thing was cuts that we reach you

something to share that name wouldn't

make sense if you disabled snow but

[Music]

I think he's passed

a crash

I'm going football is last again

[Music]

not getting any girls from that position

let's do her car insurance

crashing pumpernator I have to pay for

all of them just myself

left you placed first

so clearly I don't have insurance

[Applause]

I do think I have to do one more race

but yeah

oh no

the idea only have to get like ahead of

Mulligan card from this track and then I

don't have to do next track

[Applause]

I think I don't have this time either

because depending on the results

I can't focus on doing gymnast I can say

so Mogan doesn't seem to do that

drinking weather or what I think that

much no I I

take back the back thinking

[Music]

start station positions

actually I switch between them once more

to find out

nice

[Music]

get away from the wall

this isn't as long as this is

fine

[Music]

the car is great

you can do it I'm in the first position

already so I guess I could

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

and I shouldn't take that shortcut

thanks

[Music]

another person didn't count as a sign so

I guess I could knock it away

get away from the one

[Music]

it's not like trash

[Music]

[Music]

escaping off the paint everything

I think just adds me

[Music]

first park on the side of that okay

this means I don't have to do it to last

yeah

at this point

if you add

the

there they couldn't win

yeah if if one of those wins both Races

they will actually get more points than

me but it's only one race left so it's

an automatically

[Applause]

congratulations you have successfully

completed this circuit you have been

awarded to gold medal

give me the money

congratulations you have successfully

completed this tier you have been

awarded the gold trophy you're ready to

challenge the next tier

stuff one should I do this one

why not why why not I can take this car

it's complete it's

it's not damaged it's a this view of the

car is so blumpy for some reason

nice car you think so

okay what are the cars what cars are the

everyone else's Seasons no wait Triple A

Class [ __ ] directions

[Music]

[Music]

I don't know

I don't have a crash the car how much

did you tell

probably cost more to repair

this car then it's

it gets smoking

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

after 15.

I think it doesn't believe

[Music]

my father and I

[Music]

left

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

class

not a Durham Road oh no

I don't know

I said the time is up time for me to put

on my dress again

no more flash in the underwear

[Music]

one go

I'm thinking too much

[Music]

[Music]

let's take

back to normal yeah

I'm gonna be Norman

yes

time with a dress

[Music]

it's a shame that the start button on

the controller isn't working oops

how did that happen

[Music]

final lap

[Music]

has someone moved that one

I'm here

yeah I think

36 minutes but you said about 30 minutes

so

we've quite well estimated I must say

can pump on his driving super cars one

wearing a swimsuit as it is

all right

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

hits the kids swimsuit button

what a strange button

where do I find the reason I like the

others parameters

it was hard to read it that was the

problem

go

it doesn't really make the cake here

what the speeds were that we did

[Music]

so I mean sure it had both units but

but it didn't that it showed in either

because of how it was designed

that's a funny time

[Music]

[Music]

I can get up to speed over 200 here so

all that matters is that it's very fast

[Music]

discussion I'm coming over yeah that's

kinda

or the consequence likes to do

classification

such a long track

[Music]

but I crashed anyway

crash less but crushed numbness

how does that expression work

nonetheless I did crash test so it's not

enough numbers I don't know

I don't use

[Music]

[Music]

that in fact something Impressions

unfortunately I don't have to do the

last race

[Music]

the seconds ahead

I don't even need to try this fast

oh I rate it here

right race is in second place

[Music]

[Music]

great lap you've won the race

back to the side of the note

oh no

no this isn't good

I got the same points I rate

this means I need to win over array to

the last track should I repair a car

maybe the engine at least

my car's so broken

[Music]

too

[Music]

well I just have some ahead of ivy

[Music]

so we're sitting Turtles now

yeah I have trouble seeing try to me

the car is fine just need something

and some good luck

well it is holding together so

I guess it is fine

[Music]

you just need like this

I think there are a little bit different

track

that's weird jump shouldn't be part of

it

[Music]

you drive on the same section yeah you

take the right time for the slow track

okay take a left instead let's do this

step

[Music]

look at a beautiful little pixel

background

um

hello Papa welcome

his word if it moves and shouldn't

expect

if he doesn't even [ __ ]

that would be 40.

a couple girls affect me

and some

painting wire and it doesn't matter if

it should be good girl

yeah as long as it's all together that's

all that matters

[Music]

and my singing yeah definitely

it's very good

and of course

if he doesn't move

and shouldn't move it's all good

the engineers Master yeah that's

final lap

as long as it tells us to get it the

exactly

hopefully in the car doesn't break apart

[Music]

[Music]

well I have a good lead above average

now again

I remember I had this uh king of vanilla

cakes that one

you have shown before well I've seen it

I mean yeah

I've seen it before

one of those means

going around on the internet

[Music]

who plays that sign on this street this

should be Dexter Street but not through

it

foreign

I remember that

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

well let's get to the girl and finish

this race

[Music]

I think the two variance connect again

at the city there

yeah

this car is so broken

I think a fry pan congratulations fine

you have successfully completed this

circuit you have been awarded the gold

medal

yes 305 000. congratulations

you have successfully completed

plus I need to prepare the engine once

as well so I did lose the money on that

this car is somebody's here

I'm back at half a million again

well maybe I should try this

thing again but this time I should try

to

basically get one car ahead

each time or something

try to damage the car as little as

possible

okay

[Music]

let's see if we can do it without

damaging the car

[Music]

it count

[Music]

it's something

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

final lap

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

but now I'll start in second position

now I don't have to mess with those cars

I only have one card to mess with

there's a white joke here so

one go

okay almost

knife damage here I don't seem to cry

but

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

I think I did it quite well so

[Music]

[Music]

yes that Paris isn't here

destroying his car

[Music]

I don't have to be starting this car

just to ensure

such first today's process inside nuts

and I would have done it if it wasn't

for one friend is getting across been

signed before me and I love that he

takes

[Music]

okay

pretty fast across.com

[Music]

yes life

not damaging this suspension

it's It's Tricky

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

that was pretty cheap

aggressive racing from Papa I haven't

done anything wrong here

thank you

oh sorry I didn't I keep forgetting

as far as the wild thing to the trees

are parked behind the trees okay and

backtrack

I guess in first place so I don't have

to mess with all the cars

have suspension damage that's it very

hard to avoid

[Music]

smartwatch wait can you become a

fact

[Music]

crack

I don't remember that team Center

[Music]

[Music]

you got this one with very

this and everything song

can't say is that

whatever you call it in English

the only thing that will be vocalized in

this one

there's actually something

[Music]

nice suspension balance again

no I'm a kitten yes yeah

it's by anything quite confuse me

made some Polish meatballs for dinner or

like dinner dinner honey

[Music]

that's why I was late to the show

I mean that's fine

polish meatballs seems like an important

thing today

the songs down

Optimus sign sounds like someone getting

hit by a car

we need a song for this game that sounds

like someone keeping him by card it

keeps let's see

but all songs should be original to the

game so

only released for the game

still owned by the artist named Kingston

it's not like they are

marketing them

monetizing them in any other way except

for this game so

[Music]

there we go you've won the race I just

parked there okay it doesn't damage the

car so it's fine

that sounds yummy

I never had polish meatballs I only have

Swedish meatballs which of course are

just called meatballs in Sweden

yeah

which has confused some people like

yeah the the Swedish meatballs I just

called meatballs in Sweden

[Music]

it shouldn't be surprising

I'm about to make some breakfast right

now

very fast

but as you can make

and it's this track again

and I do it without taking damage this

time

first

[Music]

nope

well it's dinner for me since I've

worked friendship yeah makes sense

do you live like in a different time

zone

this is the track where I'm push both

system yeah that was the track

I don't know I'm doing timing

snowman

come on that was slow

it was slow

okay not too slow enough

snowman track now is the backtrack

it's a cracked track

I don't know

I'm acceptable thank you

yeah the track scenes mirror stuff

a little different

[Music]

all this time I get Swedish means balls

is when I go to IKEA

let's sing Ever from Sweden is

it's not

yeah I don't think link Empire is my

favorite however after I had tried

adding a berry strawberry combination

and that actually works pretty well

on its own

I'm not

kind enough

first I've heard that ending America's

one with meat such as meatballs

Beauty

but at least meatballs

don't take as much time to make twice as

sausage

I don't know for me it probably takes

this much time

and let's continue

Berry and strawberry Sun yum

although I haven't had that in a very

long time and I'm sure I'm not sure if

it's just Lincoln Brown Strawberry mix

together three two what if they have

have added water fruits

[Music]

oh can I make this track without

crashing

[Music]

although I didn't prepare the cars so

the numbers on the senior at the moment

[Music]

I think they were at once

0.0156

but I didn't take the paintings out of

the freezers I couldn't make sausages

I don't know how you make sausage so

this is train tracks not the Streets

back up on the street

I was talking about food is making me

hanging

that

good thing I'm cooking right now yeah

that's good

then get your own food very soon

all right

I'll be making

carbonara

tomorrow

remember that

that's easy quick to me

that's

the name of some kind of combination

yeah because I think I remember like

spaghetti carbonara

it's like

if I'm not mistaking it it's like cheese

and ham

and then yes so

that's the carbonara you can't replace

pasta whichever pasta you want to use

if I get the carbonara

slap you've won the race

carbonara

if you know how to make meatballs you

can make sausages don't need any eggs as

a binding agent

yeah I don't probably don't need their

credit card I need to get some extra

damage but do I even need to do the next

race

yes I did because it's our elimination

it's my day off so I'm going to have fun

cooking today I go to making sure that

with eggs and then I'm probably making

some chicken chicken

three two one go that sounds good

again

[Music]

it's a Snowman

snowman down there and I guess that's

some of the Snowman on this track

this is my warm-up for the high snake

stretch challenge

and I really wanted who I'm going to

face off against

probably not the same kind of car

and I don't know what to track it is

hiding

[Music]

right the car didn't flip away that's

something

It's the final lap

even though whoosh regained his farm

Authority

he still will

snowman there were a comfort here in the

North Front this night

and it's

[Music]

whatever

all right something he's come touch with

me yeah

I kind of feel like that too

let me know

[Music]

but with other things

[Music]

I've been in a low points in my life and

I'm signing up from it

things I have experienced during that

time

can still be something I can look back

at

all right

apps that I'm making coconut from that

I guess won the race

it would be interesting to

experience more not the low point of

life congratulations

no wait she wasn't like that

you mean my money move on to the next

circuit yeah let's see it is snow Rich

of course it's never easy

what other track with the thoughts of

Arizona Pro

we're taking on the final lap

I have a better card than computer

it's Thursday

Nation

the my car don't have the ability to to

apply

that's a special opinion that the

computer have

they're striked up in that lift around

and landed on the roof

yeah that car

that car is broken

it's not going to run anymore

[Music]

thank you

[Applause]

it's every time it's my car is a bit

damaged so it doesn't perform as well as

it could

[Music]

huh nothing more damaged

and speaking of more damage

[Music]

[Music]

you've won the race

here we go I did win

I wanna congratulations you

congratulations you have successfully

completed this tier you have been

awarded the gold trophy you're ready to

should I date his friend

in La Nina

what can be ah you can use any car

A detention

you wanted to learn some good Italian

recipes to the YouTube channel called

Pizza

Vincent CEOs played I made a few of

these recipes that I always get

interested

the name sounds a bit Italian I assume

it's an Italian showing Italian recipes

saying I had to check that out I love

cooking I used to be a cookbook when I

was 79 years old

that's interesting

learning more about kitten

I'm gonna cook explain ahead at work was

for enough work that Subway but I also

really enjoy cooking yeah Subway cooking

it's not difficult cooking

yeah when I was 16 I was a

Boss chef

sauce making sauces I don't know and

then after that I got moved up to main

main cook yeah that's not how we spent

spent unless you've worked in Maine

and lion cooked

when I was around Lexington I didn't

Somewhere Out There

magazine doesn't find the tape cracking

no you don't say

anyway let's see when I was 16.

kind of like a chef assistant

um okay and then after that when 2018

whenever it was that I got to be mean

cooked there nothing no no that's great

I don't know what's wrong with my son

that's a black English

is your cardboard upgraded too

yeah it should be

it's

it's not upgradable

but if I compare it to this one

which is fully after it

I mean

guess it's like

[Music]

I mean this the other car is that there

this is highly probably because my car

is broken or something

probably

[Music]

well should wait

should I do a prediction

so these are Championship computers

should have done that and well I was

okay

this is an India

championship

first

second is third or fourth four four so

eight should probably the same

or should I split that no I don't think

you guys need splits off right

and I will fill up my drink

it as you see in the information it's

two lapse per race there's three races

on the Raceway one two and three they

should have called the first one once

the computer is the hardest computer

level

there are five opponents

even though there are eight

senses what

no one has made a mistake here

all right yeah I brought it to

portrait yeah it's 46 48 whichever it is

why does it say five opponents but eight

places in morning

I went

feel free to make predictions

and don't worry about making protection

it because if you're the only one making

prediction the prediction won't happen

and if

I predict a predicted value that or

rather unpredicted value that no one

predicted is the winning value you also

get your money your points back so don't

yeah so there will always be at least

one winner or all the points back that's

the rules I used

so

let me just fill up the my drink

here we go

so how is it going we have a

Sun prediction coming in two people

voted first

we need at least one person going

against voting a metal place or a

non-metal place

anyone

should I

think I've done my kids

I could probably purchase a Porsche

and I'm gonna purchase other

the only one a single one

what is a bonus portion as well which I

guess is the one I will win

I could buy the bonus Porsche and

compete in championship and win

fresh

now I can't buy a bonus washer okay

and I apparently don't have enough money

for the regular position

I need to sell that other car which I'm

not going to use

goodbye

now I have money for the other project

and Olive comes in pink

now I

go back together pink

every every car has a slightly different

shade of paint

when

I'll do this one in the middle it says

model such there's only one Valley I see

I wouldn't even be allowed to use the

bonus button so as the title specifies

the prediction is for the La Nina

Championship should be tournament

specifically not this one

[Applause]

three but feel free to predict for the

the other

tournament I will do

practice oh how slow this goes

so we have some new viewers feel pretty

prediction which is this

second tournament not this one

we need at least one other person

predicting one of the other options

addiction

yeah I could still keep it but it would

mean

if the first place wins he will win the

first points back

kind of any other abduction means then

the everlasts

the condition will pay councils and you

get the points patch

well I can't believe that so

turn on the lights

[Applause]

10 summer

heart guest

[ __ ]

volume

thank you that's my Mexican

[Music]

I of course don't speak Polish

so I especially this track but I'm gonna

use a different card

and it's going to be much more difficult

computers computers at the hardest level

[Music]

this car is so slow okay yeah

[Music]

depending on what emphasis you want

[Music]

[Applause]

I could be wrong but the thing I get is

like

the difference between this car has such

just low speed and this car sucks just

like that

[Music]

but of course the second one in English

is ambiguous from White Socks one let's

finish version would be specifically

about its speed or acceleration could be

that too

prepared to think about that stuff

well the time is running out and we

don't have a second pin as as someone

predicting any other results

it looks like the prediction isn't going

to happen

[Applause]

there's still time left anyone even if

you you can put in a single point

there you go we got someone predicting

great nice

I like that

welcome and thank you for clicking hello

Papa it's

you're the one listening I had

confidence in you you have yeah you have

us all next at hand you have a certain

amount of confidence

you think are doing good but not perfect

I mean that's fair I do make mistakes

yes that means that prediction can

happen

[Music]

and I can switch over to the other

jumpsuit in the middle of this so that's

no problem so we can take care of the

information right away

[Music]

if you are up against a little cheetah

oops

[Applause]

is it is a time to energy

no this is someone someone's being a

cheater here

not falling in the rooms I think hit

Pizza

like yeah

it's actually the word cheater

but

isn't isn't it smells like cheetah in

sometimes I might not get the

pronunciation exactly

it's ambiguous which works to see

sometimes or something

[Music]

what

and I was not very responsible for that

English pounds are fun I mean I would

say any no probably no no no this is fun

I mean if you only understand English

well in that

so anyway depiction timer is over you

need to find that here

just vhd tone

yeah I got inside

terrible but

while everyone is dead now he was very

sick

I don't have the most points so that

cheetah was cheating anyway let's switch

over to the real right now

Pro cap

which is a panic cult and it's a

tournament so not bad definitely

93 of all the points put towards these

predictions is on the first position

that that feels good there's some plenty

of confidence

oh yeah so seven thousand doesn't it

send it the actual value I went

and

well we'll see how it goes

do you want to change outfit a lucky

outfit Maybe

a kitten

before us touch base

not even naked they haven't even written

anything

in quite a while now

I was in that case I started race no

more waiting

and now passing during the prediction

because

oh it's night oh I didn't shift and I

guess that was surprised by everyone

do you have yeah I can't see what cars

the other ones are using after the race

away

[Music]

I mean the ranks

lonely

I didn't understand why

Future Past the deck I mean I'm not

driving the best that's probably why but

that's also feel like they're trying

faster than I mean

like they're high top speed

try to slide the damage but that

I don't think they've been driving

perfectly idea

[Applause]

do you think as far as I know the

computer do take damage to you

and that's going to affect the

performance

yeah I said it's can be quite tricky

no

the glass is broken

wow

where is it turning it is a bad describe

it's not raining or anything

it's usually

[Applause]

he's getting faster I'm not ready today

cool

[Music]

do you want to see

like that nope I don't

foreign

[Music]

as well as I hoped

oh oh my okay ramrods that beats are the

ones that

I need to do something about

the night

three two one go

let's see it's kind of that card somehow

have the Next Generation or did not be a

bad spot or something

excuse me

[Music]

touch the car and lost control

okay

here's me coming soon

in the comments

I am really trying to get in first

business now so

first day

well whoever could have those cones I

hope they aren't upset about that

[Music]

yeah I'm running into

that dividing would have been ended

[Music]

again my class lap

I'll slap they must even a car in the

way

I see

phones everywhere I wonder the bus

here it is

[Music]

no yeah I don't think can those foreign

[Music]

and Now 46 is the highest point so all I

have to focus on now

is winning and that should and check the

comments of it now

uh

yeah there was no new comments good

yields for rabbits

well yeah I guess that's that's that's

yeah there we go 200 000.

thankfully last race so the only thing

let's check here basically had to come

before ramrod that's that's the main

focus

if I come right behind cheetah like if

cheetah wins I come second that should

be fine

think maybe

yeah because it's 2015.

and that's on a five points difference

so that should that's fine

so I don't do anything stupid

like for example if she takes in first

place I'm in second place I don't have

to get in first place I could take it

easy and actually a secure a second

place instead of trying to go for first

place one go

[Applause]

but I had nothing to do with that crash

just driving peacefully and then

I had a massive hash

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

oh

[Music]

collator

that posted calculator

oh I did see you later

oh it's cool later let's

hey hello Mr collator

and see you later

but I made it a bit more clear by using

lowercase

L and r i mean TMI so it's c u late

then

now it's uh

and I can't just put it on the office no

I guess that's best

okay

I'm driving so badly

I'm distracted by the ugly name

later

I'll see you later see you later

last position

is right behind yeah so yeah

but if she's a managed to get past me

it's nothing

[Music]

fine

[Music]

[Music]

but it can't be as another car between

me and cheetah

[Music]

okay so is 30 points for the first

position

but it's still 25 points per second

position so it's still a fine

coincidence the difference I remembered

[Music]

because of the two races a and you're

coming first

Monday comes first twice is 60 points

coming second place is fifth apart

[Music]

which means that shita can come in

second place and I can come inside place

if some other random driver who

cannot have who has less than 10 points

or more than 10 points less than

anything interesting right

congratulations for some reason this

track was very easy I don't know why so

that's uh that's how we

didn't look great at start

but

we completed this circuit you have won

the bonus car

thank you congratulations you have

successfully completed this tier you

have been awarded the gold trophy you're

you're ready to okay that was the first

position whoa that means that YouTube

will win 510 points split between you

um

kittens put Let Me

yeah keep them at 5000.

uh let me see if this is quite

so that means that keep them will get

3604

and oremian will get

but you still have to do like two

thousand divided by seven thousand times

510

145 which of course means that one point

will be put uh

no way it will be lost but that's how

twitch works I do think Korean should

get it

for mathematical reasons but anyway

so

confirm that kitten it's 360 and 64

Bohemian 145

let's see if this if this if it's true

and in that case I have understood how

this system works

is that these starting numbers that

showed up next year

point

364 Alec it's it's true

good and then I understood how this

system works I think that's a nice

confirmation basically

so it I still have this Championship

which one race left on

The Remains should get 145 I wish 146

but oh well

twitch has said that they always run

down

what is the this uh mathematical

function which I don't know the name for

a rounding technique

because because there will be one point

over

after running down but the first decimal

place for Uranium is seven when the

first decimal place for kitten is two

therefore Every Man Has the higher

decimal points and should never gets

what that point that point that is left

over there there is a method there is a

name for this rounding I think I hope

maybe listen I think this I think

before but I have no idea what it is

probably someone's name

because it is not the same as regular

rounding I mean yeah regular running

around seven up and two down but

reference is here if you have someone

with seven someone six and someone two

and it's only at a single point the same

will be rounded up with six rounded down

and similarly 742 and you have 2.0

remaining the seven and seven and four

will be rounded up but two will still

run it out

so

no one has any clue of what this kind of

running systems come

two

it is a nice system to ensure that every

point is is given out without

and

without creating or removing points

there's of course one exception but

[Music]

and the exception is

after giving out all the points and you

have one point remaining or just make

secondary how many points but in this

example you have one point remaining

but two people that now has the same

decimals

after remaining

[Music]

in that case you cannot split one point

some two people and you can't you can't

prioritize one person over the other so

either

so you basically have to lose one point

but the risk for this is much

less common

I mean the losing point in this way is

rare

to everyone that predicts with the

different amounts

compared to harvest volume down

which we lose a lot of points

[Music]

I want this

why why

why are you

Stood Still on the track and reversing

I'm going to use this rings

kind of crazy driver instead

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

let me pass thank you

makes us keep out in the

in the sun it's so smart

and apparently not smart enough to know

the name of it

is easy

you can't know from just looking at one

number how you should around it you have

to look at all the numbers

yeah I didn't do that stuff when I got

two thirds you have successfully

completed this circuit you have

congratulations

I had to try again

one more try

[Music]

okay bronze

yeah I did

three two one go

[Applause]

fat boy ties

[Applause]

it's up on the side

okay yeah

but that promise is not enough I need to

win

the gold in every

good playing cards

and I have gone in

every circuit completed except this one

and of course start back on

tier of circuits I haven't even done yet

but

I can't have as a scene of bronze for

entering that circuit

FTA

they're going to laugh at me

[Music]

yeah we're gonna do this one how these

sideways

I actually got silver ones

or twice I don't remember I know I've

got it once at least

and also

then there was that knockout I actually

came in second but they don't have

silver medals

so I got to cinema once

and I got in second place twice

and more than twice it will count two

times the game

for some reason turned off when I was

getting almost getting second position

which may or may not have anything to do

with what I did

[Applause]

I must have some other kind of

connections

where you kissed

why it isn't

where everyone used my votes first place

and then I come this place I haven't

gotten first place on every prediction

so far

do you have a redeem where you can make

your own

request that yeah

requests

and your own prediction where I will

refund the

at points so you can then use it into

prediction

you talking about last week when the

game kept crashing for reasons I know

exactly

it just shut down for reasons I know

three two one until I actually won the

race at that time yesterday

so strange

[Music]

thank you

we'd have that works

why is this

is

[Music]

how about that

Lighting in the first place

out touching the other time

it it looked so smooth and looks like I

made it and then I realized

I know I'm not going to make it also why

is this race track why is there a metal

divider

the price that I

got three lanes

probably it's an enclosed track

[Music]

except for the start

except for a start where you would like

a middle dividers you know how to put

the cards

but okay

okay I'm not yet in charge

[Music]

but there's one section which I am when

I realized how the men sing is

essentially strange

and

also they don't have the line one but

anyway in the tunnels here they have

a solid line

so no passing allowed in the tunnel but

it's a race track

you don't follow

this is a fun of the days

[Music]

that's not how race tracks work

what the scraping the conversations you

need to go

and I'll say I didn't not that one

I didn't want that but uh I wanted to

confirm that and I was like I didn't

change my outfit back v21 at the same

time

now I can do this

I can do this

I don't need to repair the car

[Applause]

I feel like I'm standing a bit too far

for it but

[Applause]

[Music]

[Applause]

how about that moment

[Music]

it's already opened

wait it wasn't the previous track winter

this is awesome

the first track is probably summer or

spring

the seasons Arabic backwards

[Music]

this track also has names

the thing is which I mentioned before it

would be one thing if this dashed line

was part of the road picture and I used

just use the same row texture as the

other tracks in their parties

yes the designs with it that would make

sense if that was the case but as far as

I've checked in the game

these lines are separate objects laid on

top of the track so they have

intentionally added these lines

so they could have saved somewhere I can

not feel edit them

[Music]

that's the yellow

all right sure

no problem

and this starch whoops and the uh

these yellow kind of things you're

welcome

this yellow textures here those are

action textures on the road

so here they have intentionally stopped

throwing the Wi-Fi

so everything is on purpose and that's

what confuses me

and that sounds a very strange by

brushing lines

things all the names disappears our

lanes except for left nose merges at the

same time

power Edge tires oh this car is broken

[Music]

or anything I don't know

mm power

my arms are supposedly besides now

that's something which for us to read

[Applause]

slap you placed first

[Applause]

I tilt in the reverse the whole race

there we go that was an easy win

congratulations you have successfully

you have won the bonus car

congratulations you have successfully

completed this tier you have been

awarded the gold trophy you're ready

look at this gold

oh well let's do the North American here

well in this case

since I got the girl you got the bonus

card

I can't

can't

sell this one because I don't need it

anymore because I got better car

that got 2 million

I also got this car

I'd rather keep this card in this car

because this is black

[Music]

and it shouldn't matter because both

cars are identical and black is boring

right pink is much better right

but I get three millions from this one

so

they got a family and I don't think I

need to sell any of the other cars I

keep the bonus value and then keep the

regular variants I think that's good

I don't need to but but still

well I guess

let's continue the game

let me just checking one more thing just

one thing that has annoyed me a bit

so we started the European tour

and we have those tracks nothing special

about that

then we were over the highest things

we have those tracks

and then we go to the world tour

I will point it out since the seeds we

have these tracks

and then we have one the Chevrolet cup

is just to RaceWay so

moving to Memory Lane

and

here did not get a second floor of

memory lane

first time Empire City shows up

and then

wait wait remember name yeah

and then there's no Empire City in any

of these

none of this

and there's a cup on the raceways

and no Empire City on nfts either

and of course this is the race point and

finally North America cup

and on Monday oh here again the second

time

and on there

ever it's very interesting

so there we go

few times throughout the whole cineplay

mode will you drive on Empire City while

those other tracks are repeated over and

over again

oh well

two laps four laps

I guess this one should be really quick

no reason to dwell on that

is probably interesting

I wonder if this because

oh take it easy plane

so anyway

yeah

whoops

I did I forget your Paddy card oh well

engine isn't damaged

foreign

[Applause]

do you go race in space

sanding

their honor races in space

however this is actually a mod

there are mods for this game and one of

the mods she makes one of the tracks a

space track

[Music]

I don't think it was that great what

track

um

it's a quite

extensive mod because it changes the

this is all the graphics in there right

for that reason but

nonsense

I love being two tracks comes quite with

I did that again quite repetitive with

because it's basically the same over and

over again but I mean it's for a mod

okay yeah it's still impressive see it's

like one person maybe

that sense is impressive

all right

oh

it's called The Fast and Furious part

right now

show a fast and furious has two space I

don't remember them going into space but

I haven't watched any of the film so

they might just as well go to space

[Music]

maybe I shouldn't repair the car just to

be on the same side

oh my name is nothing cool

I don't need to I can do it for Lost

Canyons I might need to do a credit card

for that

[Applause]

well it is raining one go maybe I

shouldn't have repair it

see now I better accelerated

but when it was the race to win there

and yeah it was the same in the previous

rings too this should be the hardest

computers as far as I know but when it

was the championship to win the uh

oh

remind me to check what cookies level is

I think they should be the same heaven

but for some reason these computers are

easier championship

tend to happen when it rains in this

game

he canceled the race nah it's fine

they are you know I take credit down to

the car so maybe I should have read it

nah it's right

it's fine

got my chest

it kind of bumped me

I spin out potatoes just fine

maybe my car is light

I haven't checked that

final laps

it's scraping the road again

I would like a second place at least

unless if they test

what's catching up but

I remember in one time when I was in the

parking lot

at work and the lightning ball strike

happens well

that was no more than three meters from

where I was parked

oh that must have been loud

I haven't

unless I mean you didn't say you were

next to your car you might wash the car

from a distance

or whatever

Gary yeah I haven't

like closest

yeah

that's only three

what about since I mean I don't think

now you print out the matching cake

great yeah

incredibly

without ketchup yeah 46 points in lean

actually 85 so that's no problem

yeah it's championship

yeah the car was so broken it performed

so badly

so it's the highest level computers but

for some reason I can I can drive faster

in these computers but in the other

Championship they were faster than me

very loud and two seconds before it

happened I felt electricity

go it runs first everything like that

that must

and quite a short time for the eyes as

well

must be quite the experience and

talk

and no pun intended

[Music]

and

it does sound

[Music]

yeah crazy weather over there

that would be scary

to be outside

[Music]

but it's kinda like putting your arms up

at an old CRT oh yeah that was a death

right after shutting it off

you never just throwing you I can

imagine being much stronger but yeah

that was a

tiny hair on the body

there's a name for that that kind of

hair

yeah I remember that

I haven't gotten the experience you

think that

very long time for obvious reasons

[Music]

[Music]

there was one left

he means 40 seconds

[Music]

let's see how much I can finish off yeah

Championship today

and then there will be and then

yes I'll be finishing the game next week

probably on Monday

[Music]

and then I could do like other Gamers

and like

to store the map just send me what

strange things down

activity

[Music]

what the tractor instead community

follow along

don't get to those comments

[Music]

wow

I didn't realize I had a 30 second lead

easy

[Music]

great lap you've won the face

this is me to hit the tree but

that's what I wanted to do

so I only need to win over magma this

time because that would give me enough

points to win the tournament

I think I could double check the

settings yeah there's four points

difference and there's five point

difference between the positions I

should probably cut just to be short

and that's crazy

yeah I'm sorry the outfit and

it's

I don't think I ever struck my life and

every I've been able to survive but it's

always close when I was a kid

they were always hurricanes and I

remember something he didn't mean and

when the hurricane hit

and I got cut in the face real bad oh

oh that sounds terrible

you have a scar from it still to this

day I do have scars from

accidents

half

and anyway let's move over to Aquatica

but like calling in and telling them I'm

not

coming in just had to like in God's back

within 20 minutes of me a bit for me it

just Carver has seen for me Isn't that

why you want to go to work

get away from me like boss

any clothes guys yeah

Factory stuff

yeah I was thinking too far back and

so these are Aquatica the other track is

authentica well let's see something like

that

they have nice things like that

is it that this track is so dark for

being

the beginning of today

[Music]

and it's in the rearing here is looking

through the wall

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

and humiliate myself

and you'll hear myself and see me

if I can find some

covers of the songs

[Music]

all right yeah I just need to make sure

the music is a good volume here

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

here we go

keep down driving terribly but

good enough for doing this one

you've won the race

[Music]

okay let's see what the scar

conversation

went

congratulations you have successfully

completed this circle no I don't have

any cool scars on my face but you can

see why I hit me on the face if you live

closely but there is a scar on my left

leg money that happens

a long time ago

I have a scar on my chin from when I

fell off my bike up in operating I also

have a sky from

ugly it's not all right I would say if

you can call it a scar at this point

is a very bad

but

on these

ugly looking

but I also I have another scar on my

left hand by a fan of a horse

all my horse

I want sports bike riding and lost a new

competition because I ran off but the

horse stepped on me oh

horses can be heavy

right

I must have hurt

and also my job on drugs one time oh no

because

I don't like

I don't like we did this guy because I

was unboxing in another tournament when

I was young and the guy hit me in the

job really hard and broke you have been

quite quite active

Prospect riding boxing

refracting bike I mean yes that's what

people do that but

but okay of course then

damage damage yeah of course

set here

you got a sense

aside from that point

[Music]

I don't

I don't know where I was going with that

so I'll move on and my small sky on my

left hand between someone or fingers oh

when I accidentally stab it while

cutting vegetables I wasn't paying

attention to where the knife was going

yeah that wasn't

like close to those other things

[Music]

um

yeah the terrible broken

nail from when I got my finger

slammed in the door that's a good way of

describing it

and it broke

it's hard to think very busy and it's

basic group name and since

I've had

it's been a broken for quite a while

but it is healing

I have the same thing except on my left

hand I have a scar on my pinky and

lightning finger where I got in the

fight in high school

before I dropped out and the guy had a

knife and he cut being really bad

to buy in the arms were like not useful

but

that's horrible

that's very sad

but judging for that that means that

your fingers are still unusable which

surface is great stats

they managed to heal

I haven't done so many scars take it

easy people I mean you of course

my fight was

[Music]

horrible

I have another scar on the back of my

head

and the ball spot because of it for my

younger brother

likes me and he that I hit my head on

the corner of the wall like some paint

off the wall too

oh

that seems like a random thing to do

were you in on that or

[Music]

and I'll continue

watch more laps this time

other than that I think one is doing a

great chef racing thank you

oh there's a light track I'm not going

to hit each other but I think it hurt me

that's great

so you continue video gaming

I guess video games I usually like

well I mean if you're using a controller

you know mostly all the needs

for some

and

one or two fingers depending on

safe and sound

uh

now it's this part

to press the triggers

I know yeah I shouldn't have taken that

part I should have gone on the other

side

but the other thing it would hold it

yeah they kind of made for

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

well I I guess I could

say

people

who have disabilities

because I just remember that thank you

at least people I watch have us at least

added

I think that

visible disability or something like

that like that

[Music]

and

it's still great to see that they are

able to play games

and

quite well that's their

foreign

that's great to see

oh next second no I'm just coming with

this

in our side to side track here

oops

um

hey papa how's this dream this dream is

fine

my driving seems to be fine too so

I will joining at night without

headlights so that part is not fine

so

[Music]

so I have

evidence

actually something to talk about uh

what's here yes how do you make corners

more toys there's too much corners

I'm just crashing oh

okay let me take this comment I was

curious how you change the font in chat

a code or something

it's it's my own chat okay I mean it's

from existing code so

there's an existing code that comes from

stream elements I have modified but I

have not made any changes to

how it

actually I might change it to how it

works with Emojis but the original code

happens emojis that's fine so if you

would add one of your channel emails

then move up here just fine it should

appear just fine hopefully

they did that with the default codes

and it should still appear just fine

with my customers which is built on the

default codes

I think the hot spot is turning

and it's Darkness yeah I remember

HTML because it's back in the day but

this in this case it's a JavaScript and

it's kind of artifact human and so

change colors

of fun six seconds

yeah 23 comments and running at the same

time when it's dark it's very hard

[Music]

practice

[Music]

I don't want to come up there

never enough

I guess that was another thing just race

no I refuse to I need to eat comments

and that's what I'm here for

eign

[Music]

come on

come on

oh that was close

all right let's let's climb some

positions now

that was the white one

another one of myself running

okay everyone want to stop driving

anymore I had nothing to do inside

Valentine

[Music]

on your phone

outside and bright sunlight I think it's

a knife

and the hot screen is probably just

black

but maybe some elements visible

retirement I mean the UI is actually

probably very easy to use

[Music]

[Music]

oh sorry about that

yeah my engine's smoky

that's nothing to worry about

the engine it happens

hopefully next track is not doing

tonight

oh no

the engine is making strange senses

no it's another

yeah I don't think the engine is feeling

definitely

[Music]

yeah I'm not going to get the first

place

but I hope I can get a second place

okay let's let's okay

scratch that

you can get a certain things

[Music]

oh hello I guess I get the second thing

[Music]

just didn't have to chat about getting

the second things I just foreign

[Music]

great left congratulations you

the car is smoking it's

it's fun just a little eye burning

the car is fine

it's a little smoke that's that's normal

yeah

one million third party card

oh

no it's fine

Korean now we reach hopefully please no

still and no night I could have checked

that but I mean I it's not like I can

change it

it's fine oh it's nice

each night

go

and it's snowing

[Music]

and I thought the car has no problem

driving this now just still Subway

[Music]

building a pyramid now

do I come to your channel and then

pyramids did I

[Music]

think

that was him ever

[Music]

[Music]

like pyramids that quickly

[Music]

I got this i got this

foreign

[Music]

yeah it's not like I'm trying to break

them I think

that he just

[Music]

don't smack her

you have a lot easier points

now mine is enough

[Music]

of that thing

[Music]

[Music]

tonight and weather how much

I mean I'm not far behind in you guys

but

as soon as I catch up I get to be too

excited

to drive too fast okay

[Music]

I'm doing nothing it's so great with

tunnels but that's something

oh

[Music]

behind

and then this guy was the price pass

like nothing

[Music]

thank you

again

thank you

I am doing my best

I'm gonna do a lost distance to the car

ahead what's up has my best

okay I mean technically the first

episode because I start from stands here

a second one

most of the time being fasted

it's going to be the best step

but um

[Music]

we're here to reset five thank you that

was what I wanted

[Music]

one mistake

[Music]

and then I thought

or the day that he stuck too far ahead

and it gets out of the way I'm trying to

drive here

[Music]

to the bunny

okay delete this 10 seconds

so much for not being too far ahead

sometimes you feel like

sorry about that

final lap

[Music]

that was kind of smooth actually

but yeah position

[Music]

we can get a second second position

nice

when I heard the cry

I have caught up

yeah a lot of company

I just see that happening

but I will try

I'm not going to keep up

thank you all right left second is bad

after the snow and it's night time

it's silly

thank you for thinking I'm silly okay

I'm pricity the second time every which

I mentioned before

grandma is cheating come from yeah I

don't know what's going on

well I can win this and I can win

dolphin park and if I win both

and ramrod comes in second but

that means that I basically if I just

win this three I win the tournament but

I guess that's it I have to win history

and of course it is

night it is snowing

and someone requests

yes that started

so that's probably why I I described

because of Rarities in in place

I was just gonna say that I'm pretty

good at this track and then I crash into

one but I mean it is raining so it's not

a waterfall in the city but is that uh

lava phone maybe

oh yeah

I don't know and there's lots of control

in question one

see now Ram Rob is no problem feeding as

soon as they are in front they're very

hard to catch up with some reason I

don't really know why it is like this

what was that

the reverse

[Music]

reverse rapid pen

thank you

lap two

Friday wish

grandma wasn't in second best place but

I won

I'm not going to try

[Music]

you strike might be easy because of her

why this is

a lot of places

three lines wide but then there's also

assignments on the sides

he's also a bit extra wide like here

all right so far it's good

now I'm needing 20 seconds great lap lap

three

[Music]

[Music]

this means I can be a bit more careful

nice inside

this one's so fine

[Music]

best left final left

finally let's do it

would be fun if I could lab someone

but they're way too far ahead

that could be possible

Destiny said

even this person's second place happens

it's four slap

a person eats

very soon

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

Let's ignore that

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

this left you placed first

well

I came first

[Music]

that means if I do that again

I Am ram ground is going to have the

same points

and then it's quindiak Park that will

the PD

raised at the time is it

[Music]

whoa

and that's more like

two one

that's ready

go

I'm ready says

[Music]

okay

get some neat but at the same time be

careful

[Music]

not like this

now said it's not rain

that's

[Music]

no no

I I guess I guess it worked out because

ramrod didn't he wasn't able to pass me

[Music]

[Music]

I don't know

in this section

[Music]

thank you

I don't think trying to take out the

signs

but um

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

and then this last section

this is the fastest

[ __ ]

that happened

oh

hey assistant

please

I do like when I can see the track I

don't know

immune

Chinese that's right

yeah that was like a Android

device turning out of there and I turned

right but there was a warm

let's do something

yeah I should probably turn right

yeah

how nice sometimes and

the headlights are quite badass

[Music]

okay not too fast

[Music]

yeah I give it yeah the thing is that

how to track dips down there it tricks

me thinking I need to turn more

I did that again

final lap

what I'm good so far

let's see if I can do

get through that

fourth section again

[Music]

foreign

these items like something

it does but

myself

repeat that again

congratulations

[Music]

now we have the same 110 points

so

the final race kenyatt Park yeah let's

do that quite well

you know I have three millions which

before I started

share well

okay

okay and as it's past a three hour mark

now so this will be the last race

wish me luck

more fun faces it's of course nice

because one is one go

[Music]

that should be well familiar with this

stretch

to be able to perform work on it

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

can I manage this without breaking the

headlights

[Music]

that was a bit too careful

[Music]

[Music]

I had nothing to do with that

disappearance

the card is

okay

[Music]

[Music]

someone has a fire burning point

[Music]

hit it again

see if I can

destroy the headlights

but is it good

[Music]

I definitely have more points more than

five points ahead of this planet

no

[Music]

however 15 points more

[Music]

oh that's that's

[Music]

amazing

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

to the next circuit

that's

the end of that

was technically into your pie

oh and

that's the best I could do

another Cinema

and then I got the one

I told you I'm not fun

but I did improve it to you girls

I did once get a cinnamon

so that wasn't the first

it was another tournament when I

gave up

until last race

though

how about

paying a visit

this summer called velvet violet

BT

oh yeah sorry sorry forgot about ready

to put some beat

tomorrow break

Thursday Friday or if you're from

Australia Friday Saturday afternoon

it will be spiral I will replace Spyro

from start again but since around I

didn't get that far into the game

but this time the game would work

properly I would be able to do it

quicker

and and everything so

that would be fun someone left already

though

that's the future

so

you want to say hello to Velvet

just copy this funny message

and

that's it that's earlier

which is a bit

so that's all I had to say it's counting

down to

see you there if you want to join bye
