can you hear me now

[Music]

my thing was tingling

hey yes

I think

me to keep track of the audience I

wonder if it was yes yes now you can

hear me because I for some reason didn't

plug in my microphone I was speaking

here with you all these

almost two hours without eating anything

great I am very smart Let's ignore that

that didn't happen at all and it did not

pick up my other microphone that I have

built into the computer that would

suddenly

make it sound awful of course and

someone could have him for me that or

someone could have said something like

hey I can't leave him here at the moment

the the other microphone raised it I

didn't see anything on the one I

realized I haven't even plugged in the

microphone

so

this is silly

it's so demanded quite yeah thank you

I've spoken in every single screen at

the moment

so yeah I've been speaking to you so

let's

no I didn't want it quiet that wasn't a

good one

anyway

look

oh yeah something's going wrong with

this

now it's doing that thing again yeah

it's doing something wrong with the leg

everything now it's doing

something wrong with the high stick

and I have gotten this error before on

modding

now

standing outside

I should have let you know yeah maybe

you should have let me know I should

have checked obviously it's not your

responsibility I cannot blame you at all

at the same time it felt like something

someone said like eh I can't hear you

saying anything you've been smoking

every you have been speaking every

single stream you're done and for some

reason you're not speaking in this

stream

is this intentional

no

it's not intentional it's just me

being stupid and forgetting to plug

stuff in so yeah

what's the cooldown for hydrate why it

doesn't say it's like three minutes or

something

there's not much I hope it's not too

much

oh it says that it is not cool down

there is a complete

and I pressed on the wrong browser

so now I have close everything down how

they browsing stuff down because that's

how Chrome Works

and then I had restarted to scroll

now I can do it from here

why did I put my head but hello

yeah I've set the height I said it wrong

I need to fix that

uh let me correct that

where do I set it in

or you don't go to

affiliate when you cut it go you go to

channel points

hydrate edit

yeah it's yeah now I actually I even set

it to two minutes

now apparently when you create a new

Scene It limits it to one use only

and you have to disable that and if you

don't disable that

and I forgot to save on that it's not

it's not like you have done anything

correctly stream I like

anyway and this was a failure of a

stream

like every stream has been opinion in

that moment

I have changed that for now and I you

can hear me speak now yeah I don't know

what this happens

this shouldn't happen it's something

wrong with the skeleton when it's like

warps skeleton for some reason

I am getting ready for work he got some

early

on stream

it's nice for you to show share

very happy that he decided

take some of your time to show up

it's a great moment that you show up now

after uh

this last an embarrassing moment

happy birthday thank you Stella

it looks cute

and yeah I still have this results some

of the issues with this mesh I would

hopefully be able to resolve them

I don't remember how I solved it last

time but I know I can fix it because I

have done that before

so

in that case

I will

uh refund the Swedish dream Swedish

phrase I meant because apparently I

spoke that

on

a while I

I accidentally didn't plug in my

microphone and my backup microphone

wasn't set to be used in

this stream so even even that one didn't

work that was just quiet for like one

and a half hours when I was speaking to

everyone

and no one said anything

it's not that everyone else's faults

obviously not it's my fault we're not

checking but still no one said anything

like

it's quite uh yeah I loved Avatar

birthday outfit it's not a birthday

outfit I don't have a birthday outfit

it's a redeem

to change outfit

I got I got two outfits you can choose

between

so that's one is active for the moment

I guess if you activate the other one it

would overshide it I think one of them

shorted something

he's not automatic I don't know how I

would do it

apparently I rely on how old the redeem

is but if you activate the other redeem

while the first redeem is enabled that

won't mess with the numbers

for me only

okay it's the first time I've seen this

performance it's not like it

and here's the full outfit

because it's a swimsuit

but they can't really show

like

if I try to fit the whole character on

screen it takes too much space to play

so

I'm lost

oh yeah and then I switched back to that

thing

but yeah

um

so yeah something is wrong here I need

your son

it's so cute

yeah yeah

I'm happy you think so uh [ __ ] I I don't

I'm really bad at this stuff like

like

she's like

I said no

I'm I'm a really social awkward

um

oh my

the um

I should be able to

sit here and then it shows up

foreign

everything here but it's somewhere here

it breaks for some reason

like this phone or something that breaks

and I I don't know why everything looks

perfectly normal here

or other bedroom here it is that

shouldn't affected

it's not negative values or anything so

in there

I don't know

it's sex completing completely different

automatically change view to like the

latest active window

but

it is one doesn't have support for that

is there any way I can get a full

picture of pom pon in the cute outfits

I guess

I don't know I don't really like

Maybe

we'll see about that

so but

the music

[Music]

for research exactly

nothing else

she is a cute bunny

too cute bunny

wait there you go

Hannah is inside some capsules yes

but why

is this one being wrong for some reason

I don't see why it would be wrong

I am confused

I'm going back to blending

um

this skeleton as far as I can see it's

perfectly fine

or is it

no

no it's the same exact same skeleton but

out of the Muse that's not a problem

now that is

our friendship these are functions

[Music]

follow this

yes

um

when that means that everything I turned

everyone about before because not part

of History okay

um yes

great

what's up but some other things I have

fixed between this game and next thing

is that before when you reply to someone

and added an amount

the name of it here lucky

[Music]

and it is now no longer broken and the

reply to someone with a number in the

name it's also not no longer broken

everything is working as it should

fun fun being smart that's very training

I just want to say I'm happy that the

giant dumb stream and we met and became

friends

so nice and I'm happy when you stream

that's very nice

very nice I should say that that makes

me happy to

yeah I wouldn't have joined

these are

okay come from that Dom used

a Pom-Pom in his spiral string

which led me to watching one of his

dream and then

and everything

evolves from there

it's amazing how it's just such a little

thing can have changed so much

and might have started streaming because

I decided to

I I mean it wasn't dumb streaming and I

watched Downstream that made me stream

it was that I started doing a let's play

on my YouTube channel

which I then decided to just stream

directly on Twitch because it was

to

inconvenient to do a let's play it's so

much easier to just stream

you're great

my great what

[Music]

I think you meant you are great

but but thank you

but I might not have streamed on Twitch

and might have to read on YouTube maybe

if I didn't match the dancer that could

still have a hidden effect another

obviously we wouldn't have met so

and that's that would be very ashamed

yeah

because he's an amazing person now I

don't remember

and uh yeah like I tried to watch watch

people stream but I'm

[Music]

because yeah I don't know

[Music]

but remember which I'm basically

that we need to Twitch see whoever is

streaming and then

watch their stream and until

I don't feel like approaching anymore

but that usually takes a long time

my name is

[Music]

I don't think that's Swedish price okay

I think those videos were terrible

[Music]

I haven't had hard times in my life

making friends

sometimes people are just not welcoming

and kind some very thankful moments

like-minded people

yeah some people are

is yeah

yeah I have a hard time making friends

too

[Music]

internet has certainly helped me

although I don't see those people in

real life which

is

I mean it's that's nice to meet people

in real life and on the internet even

people all over the world and that's

in that easy to meet those people in

real life

[Music]

so

I don't know what happened with that

skeleton I will try to import the

skeleton

again but this time from from the

actional match that is supposed to have

it and see if that helps

remember I had a great view up and you

have I can't see the pine browsing

though

that's a separate window that's just how

it works

wait a minute this part wasn't

these are new things

flower stem

oh yeah I don't remember these birds

being part of this I might miss remember

maybe they were

they part of this

all right they were cute I remember you

being really yeah

my first video is not good I'm way too

nervous and

and yeah and basically when I started

streaming to the first streams aren't as

good as these dreams I definitely feel

more confident speaking

if I was in Sweden I would hang out with

you I would love to hang out with you

too

you see so nice

it would be amazing being able to

meet each other

I don't remember where you are from you

don't have to say you don't want to eh

yeah that's up to you so depending when

you are from selfie

it's like if people are from Europe of

course meets this year especially if you

are within EU

I wish I could have a vacation to Sweden

you are also nice yeah he is nice

I want to know you well right now is

there anything you would like to share

yeah

well

tell about yourself tell any

until

everything you you want to tell about

yourself of course

don't don't feel like you have to

no pressure

I mean

I assume New York

abbreviations

or acronyms that's the time okay so

but a New York I do know about

and I hope that's the one

married and I want green but I have not

you're free to be a mod here too if you

want to of course you don't

not nothing

I'm going to

it's volunteer work but

if you're modeling a channel like Don

is certainly free to mod yet if you want

to but only if you want it

yes New York that's

that's good

we're in the middle I'm

former

animator oh

and I do voice acting

you to voice it

Telemundo Mexico

that's neat that must mean that you

should be

good at speaking and streaming that case

maybe it's not that down the same thing

maybe the speaking part maybe not the

presenter on a string part but it's

being part I can imagine

I'm happy to put them here if you look

back at me

I will battle any Trials of pay

attention I meant that it's only been

two people so far who have tried to

so far just try to like advertise

but nothing

now trolling so far at least so with

this different skeleton

which apparently

I said I don't remember if that part was

part of it I should check because that's

still a good information to have

I haven't animated since to support oh

that's almost 10 years ago I'm

flightless smoke shouldn't mentioned how

long it could go it was

I'm so old

um

yeah yeah this skeleton is doesn't have

that thing so this skeleton is broken so

yeah okay so I guess that's a rule to

remember if you go to mod make sure you

import the actual skeleton the actual

mesh that has the skeleton while there's

other meshes that I have in the list

they don't actually have the

skeleton they are using the same

skeleton as another mesh

but

not all bones were imported because

those bones were unused for that much

but this time all bones were imported

including the unused bones because this

mesh is actually having their spots it's

weird I don't know how it works but it's

hopefully shouldn't be broken inside

so my drawing Skins are bad now I I

think if you

[Music]

um let me get something to drink and

give me two minutes and I will be back

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

questions

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

oh

almost exactly a few minutes

[Music]

you go

okay

[Music]

making a mess

so there you go 20 peppers

[Music]

got some bread to eat too rabbit

shouldn't eat bread but I'm a

bun again so it's fine

it's now back to the chat

Essex

okay whatever I say

so my drawing skin is about I was going

to say

you do have

I think if you get started drawing again

although I have seen some of your

drawings

so if you have kind of started drawing

so but if you draw again you you I think

you will get back into it

and

so it might take a bit extra but

I think yeah I'm super streak

[Music]

I think if you get going

I think you'll get back to it

really quickly

that's a very cool

this one is quite

I wonder if you have to send them

the animations shift

my husband's from Dominican Republic

and I learned Spanish this speak to his

family

I don't know Spanish ending

pricing learning languages are so much

fun

because you can connect

I might

okay

because then you can connect with small

people yeah and learning English for me

has allowed me to certainly

expand

[Music]

you're not open

yeah it depends on how you look at it

my grandparents are from Mexico

[Music]

imagine that

in some Spanish I guess yeah you know

how you switch between English and

Spanish

lovely

don't forget you're getting better at

sticking to one language

especially if you want the stream or

something like that

because I've seen this dream

yeah

I'm seeing them my grandparents are from

Italy hello

at the end

but my parents are from places they

attack us

come from eating so cute

red

how did you get back to the door maybe

maybe

I can teach you

teach me some Spanish

I thank you

foreign

skeleton this time

and assuming I'm blending again

and lingling didn't have any

through the glasses and shorts I didn't

I didn't want to include like

maybe a hats fine glasses I mean some

people wear glasses I

kind of do I mean it depends

[Music]

or

break down again

I don't realize it but if you select

multiple Founders you can get content of

all the filters

but I will delete everything now

because this stuff was incorrect

and it's not like you're losing any

progress because everything is basically

is important all the work is in blender

and then use the imported

[Music]

something went wrong here

Armature skeleton

yes export

to this

select it

everything is okay

it has exported

here imported

oh wait

after deleting fix up redirectors can

help

try to reimport it again

now it for some reason it has decided

that the mesh still exists

today it's a bit annoying

and the only way I know to fix that is

by closing and opening it again

it's a bit slow I wish there was like a

refresh option but

I will get back

to take the dog out okay

happy dogging wait

I hope to UNI shows up

thank him

I knew University when I started the

microphone

there's a silly moment

I got my silly projects ignore this

inner projects

[Music]

I'm looking for this map

[Music]

I have on the matzah

[Music]

a lot of those mods aren't really

completed mods and a lot of

experimentation

and probably want to get published

anyway there's nothing to publish

[Music]

between very varies

[Music]

with my dreams

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

import

it doesn't do it correctly

[Music]

why

[Music]

is this skeletal mesh the same that

doesn't make sense to me

it does make sense to me

because I'm a fool

[Music]

I'm a buffoon

I forgot to set

[Music]

relax

[Music]

I forgot they said kinda like it's like

everything and then like do this and

then it should be set for each of them

[Music]

no convenience

[Music]

so many parts

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

there we go everything is set

paid exported properly this time

[Music]

foreign

thing existed and sometimes it does have

that problem

there we go this is our Channel

import mesh

there's a nun no animations

correct scene I don't know what that is

but it's neighbors material sex is

important

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

and here we go

[Music]

oh yeah because I only

out there

[Music]

[Music]

I should see how does this works

[Music]

so it is done now I just need to put

stuff in the controllers

thank you

so

the skeletal and pH goes to the sinking

folder because

[Music]

that's what keeps on the skeleton

the materials goes to the GT only

[Music]

because that's what holds the materials

I don't know why they split it up like

that but that's what they did

so this one should be called that with

SK before because that's what they call

them

but they call them skeletal meshes

skeleton is that name

and physics assets pH has that thing

and these things should already have the

correct names

the mood part Supreme vectors

[Music]

and hopefully it will work this time

hopefully no more errors

[Music]

I have to explain to people yesterday

that Cinco de Mayo is not Mexican

intensive yeah I've heard that I've

heard that's uh

misconception

[Music]

just realized I never sent that back to

life

you typed it out and you never pressed

anything

yeah that's

that's happened to me

thank you

cooking and preparing and then I will

[Music]

just open the window

so here is that

then I will just put the jargains

characters NPC

content mesh

these are the broken ones

done with the cooking

foreign

what time is it for you

14 22.

each afternoon

then I got the waiting for

eign

yeah yeah

if my

mass is not wrong

no

I asked some of the time

I mean at that time this is normal time

this is 20 Past 14.

so anyway

um

but I'll paste here

I need some

yeah yeah

[Music]

making sure the files are updated

with the current time

back here

running this script will update this

replacing that one

panel I can launch the game

and because I only have

two minutes outbreak is to switch once

as the final minute because

so while the game starts Adventure short

short ass page for that

thank you

[Music]

as soon as that starts I don't know if

you see the head or not

got a Discord

[Music]

oh your name is black or screen it does

a bad color and no

that's it I don't know so I will leave

foreign

yes

[Music]

but now you should be here right

so

hello hello

I hope yeah okay I'd have it so yeah

yeah okay now now great great so thank

you for the follow and I have considered

setting up a Discord

so I should probably do that

add some soon probably

and then

it's sorry for

none of this nothing weird about name

it's a perfectly fine name and

and yes

I have the fun guess who it is a razor

edge too you're the second one who's the

first one

did someone take a recent age from me

but welcome research so nice to see you

and look I have modded the panda

okay successfully

and

oh my God I'm a mat you're actually

being a mud for a while

I mean do you noticed

thank you I will defend your stream

you're free to do that or free to not do

that

it's all the volunteer work

but yeah

[Music]

but I are broken still no why

why are the eyes broken

no

why is this is only one of the eyes is

working

time to analyze the inside of the panda

I should have like double sided or

something so I can see some something

easier to control it with keyboard

because the mouse has the

I don't exactly see

why I need this

so they say it's something if they like

the modding

yeah it's kind of pushing the eyelid eye

lead into the head for somewhere between

some

why is it doing that ruins everything

else

as far as I can tell

is it supposed to look like this

everything else

the hands are quite big on these pandas

everything else looks fine and I also

could solve that issue with the lake

they are

they look very cuddly they would

actually work perfect as supply chain

maybe something is wrong with the bones

but I fixed the bones

why is it doing these

uh uh well I guess I'll just have to

let's go back here

and

let me go back to it yeah

[Music]

never knew you could bought this game

smart man

I have um

I mean

[Music]

going back to the game

yeah I have

a replace spider with my Pom-Pom as a

quadruped

and this pass menu has pon pon here

doesn't it I guess the ears in there

apple is the most visible

so you can flame which

bunnies normally can't do as far as I

know

so anyway

yeah

back to morning

but there

yeah

I'm using blender

and they somewhere here but everything

the body can't change the flame for

their bite I mean technically

I have tried to modify the animations

but there are

what they call blend spaces

which they shortened to BS which

describes them perfectly they are not

working for me

so

BS just stands for blend spaces

and for some reason those

um

it

um they make the animations

they make the scale of the model super

large and wanted to ruins the whole

experience

because they are used when you're

turning flying and turning and stuff

like that

one is the reason why I can't make

months today inspired I would like to

give a public thinking it's a little fun

thank you

Edge

an Air Force

I'd say like appreciating the help I'm

provided I

I don't know how to phrase things

I always want to be nice and kind but

it's so if I face something weird do let

me know so I don't say things weirdly

and in them is that the

broken animations or anything else

so this bone

should handle and this bones apparently

the eyelids

[Music]

a bone is missing a bone is missing

of course a bone is missing let me

it's not gonna show up as me is it

[Music]

what I would like to do but I understand

that's not possible today because I only

want certain Windows to show up and

stream I don't want all windows because

you know privacy and stuff

I don't want to accidentally

so something private

be anything of course

so I currently only set it to this place

specific windows but that means I have

to go into the stream and switch switch

winners it's showing and I would like

you to automatically switch to the

active window of the windows I have

given its permission to show of course

[Music]

That's why nothing is it that's why

nothing is happening because I'm using

strong enough it was only one of these

exploring winners is allowed to show as

well

for the safe cups 20 seconds

well we're using this version of new

model I might be able to export um

working mesh but yeah that that is a

problem

and give me a moment

your mother is not going to show

when they see

because I'm using a specific version

that hopefully gives quite

I have not had issues with missing bones

before

this is first time I've seen it has

happened

and

is it the diff part of your model being

wrong

[Music]

or easy to default of the import tool to

blender being around

the person who

manages the mod has said that it is not

the humorous fault

[Music]

it is everyone else is left

I have closed the game

thank you very much

because if I'm trying to open the game

files with new model it will open

including mods I think that's an obvious

thing to exclude

but I mean the ear model is perfect

became account

at my own uh

[Music]

complaining about your mother

it is a I mean it is a free tool it is

someone who made it a perfect on their

own free time and I cannot demand

anything for someone doing a program for

free

obviously not I am very thankful for

what is available

and

not that definitely

but that doesn't mean that the software

is perfect and the person who man

develops the program should not pretend

that it is perfect

[Music]

and if the person wants to uh wants to

take feedback and make me want to make

sure that the software is working

because the person obviously wants their

software to be perfect the person must

be able to take criticism and actually

correct errors that exists because

certainly I don't think it is anything

wrong with the import tool to blender

and Export it from blender if you can

use a specific version of you mobile to

get the correct

skeleton and then if you use a later

version of new model the export is now

broken

and now the export is not broken

according to the developer now even

though it's exporting everything

perfectly both cases

the import to the blender is a pension

only when you export from the different

from the latest version that must mean

that the earlier version of your model

must have been incorrect making the

input to do it correctly so I don't know

it just doesn't make sense to me that's

what

[Music]

and he's talking to myself but no one's

writing it yet please please write in

the chat and stuff my friend

no but um yeah

the pun I'm curious have you ever

thought of making a mod in gameplay sky

mix is sent like my favorite game it's

fun to like run around but I've never

really played it seriously

and oh here we go

I

have thought about making some kind of

mod for it like I want to make a bunny

race

but in that case I have to replace an

existing one

and like I don't want to it would be fun

to have every race in Skyrim being a

different animal

that would be fun

that would be really fun No in fact

so this is the ones if I now go to

blender here's blender

and now if I import the new one let's

hide this

you know it's confident

and also the time for the outfit is over

rightly

the outfit redeem is only for 30 minutes

that was a language

[Music]

time so if I now I'll import this new

one

yeah new model

earliest version exported content this

doesn't show up on stream I can't do

much about that it would show up

if I used like

a wall

so look look look at this

but this is the older version this is

why I want to like report this to the

Creator but as I said I feel like the

creator doesn't care

it is one two three pounds one two three

bones

this is the older version this must be

broken

this is quite a look in the Roman oh I

was so excited and I left it around

oh it's still missing I was stupid

[Music]

uh it's still missing so that version

doesn't doesn't work in that case I

should

try exporting it with a later version of

your model

maybe this error has been corrected in a

later version

yeah it's a possibility

a possibility

but some skeletons should apparently

work because there's another

using an older version because the

latest version breaks

more skeletons than it

no with this version

and they have notes therefore

which engine I should use

this won't show up on stream again

and then NPC and then I need to find

[Music]

difficult three two nine

nine zero there you go

and then export mesh

and that's the exported try to see if it

exported correctly

this should show up be my hope I wish I

had a second screen so I could see

what's coming down on stream that's uh

but I haven't yeah

[Music]

and it has props as well interesting

say anything interesting anyway

no no

if this doesn't work the whole skeleton

is broken I can't do anything about it

and I don't think Kevin likes this

version as well he's going to fix that

but I can't see if there's an update

but the person is not updating it for

spiral anyways sadly

sorry you know right again

would be fun to see you know something I

wonder if it would be possible to have

class which is to my standard mod

should be possible I think

you would now wait how would you do that

would be possible because you would have

you need to rig up the clothes the bones

but I would expand the number of bones

on burns about Bones on the skeleton and

then therefore you have to replace the

skeleton and I have no idea how to

replace the animations because all that

stuff is broken when I try to replace

this

sadly

[Music]

this one is just as broken it's still

missing up I could really eat that bone

I think that's my

hydrates

I think that's my best

bet at the moment yes

pre-created

is that what values do we have I should

basically mirror these values

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

just duplicate this

and then

at minus

and minus and now we got to be the one

another and if this one is called

our early one and this one's called R I

did three this one should be called R

eyelid five let's see

foreign

oh it's there

it is inverted or something

okay what happens

hey pretty please thank you

what happens if I

this tea or it doesn't

have any kind of application doesn't

what that's wrong

no wait

and eight my three six minus eight three

minus 172 minus 36 I mean 78

minus

[Music]

is gorgeous

this is a thing

this is the head

so the head and Taylor switched position

since that's what's going on here

[Music]

and why isn't it connected today this

one

it doesn't connect what is it doing

device that they seems

connected to find

out there and now it's connecting

so now I got two bones inside each other

I don't know this phone anymore

so this is the head

this is the head

this is the head

this is the head

and just add and this is that okay

[Music]

what's made you want to make a panda

well I'm not me

you just wanted to have something simple

to do on screen

and I guess it was good singing right

here when I started the stream because I

was silly because I forgot to plug in

the microphones I sat here talking to

people in like one and a half hour

without

anyone in being able to hear me and no

one said anything

[Music]

what is everyone where is someone

watching

where did everyone go

so it does have that phone it's just

it's weird

but I tried to correct it next time with

this new one

[Music]

and you spell just as good as she

dealing everywhere else I just messing

with you I'm still here that's what

you're trying to write

hey it's always fun to see how much

do you have any variety stuff

it's funny I'm not trying to make fun of

him

I'm I'm a nice bunny

trust me

so anyway that's that

sweet so now that this is exported time

to switch unreal

check out the followers so I can delete

all current content that this content is

broken

good thing I'm only testing one at a

time

and then we go and locate me

much pandas

resources then go there it is

all right

drop it here

and I assume this Windows doesn't show

but it doesn't charge

and it doesn't do it again

sorry hey

[Music]

so and it's really important

[Music]

word okay

very far into unreal this time with the

correct one yes now it's working

I need to make sure that mesh is set to

use the Armature that I'm exporting it

with

and now it's important

it's upon what is your current status on

the Ember the Dragon Mods oh spoiling

the search that's why I learned that

it's I understand I'm still currently

waiting not really yeah and having the

Bumblebee mesh done I have no idea how I

should do it

I I have yet to find someone else who is

able to help me do it I appreciate

anyone who has tried

but Tim

and also I had a voice actress who was

going to do the Bumblebee noises

replace Sparks noises with

who has not provided with I provide with

a few but has since the provided

probably is quite busy and since I

haven't

been able to complete the balbi it has

not really been enough any it has not

been important to really

push to complete that the enemy so it's

basically yeah the complete stands in at

the moment

and uh yeah doing eat the emperor model

stream would be like way too much of a

project since I still have to work with

a lot of other people

but this one I should be able to do all

on my own

[Music]

here we go exactly directors all this I

always do that yesterday they sure could

um

nicely that means that this is the end

of the playlist

when I discredits and then just bonus

tracks and then they're stuck

alternative version of Express

[Music]

early version subject

wait where is there

why why is the shark

but there's some chunk there's the

person Jack in game version

oh these are like

the actual soundtrack of style is not

the actual assisting me

I'm sorry I need to get ready for work

but that's perfectly fine here's team is

really funny I look forward to see more

from you in the future questions

please check my schedule I tried to

stream I want to stay tomorrow but

otherwise I stream every day except

Wednesday

I stream at different times so hopefully

you can find a time that works for you

if you check twitch schedule it will

provide it in your time soon

otherwise I of course have made a Time

sensing here so Monday Tuesday Thursday

Friday Saturday just secure time zone

and then when summertime ends in Europe

I was doing one hour

later

and so you have to add one hour but

that's that's in November

until summertime ends in United States

in that case you also move back one hour

and then we're in sync again

that's it that's like an exception there

the stats months in the teachers that's

right but that's what that bottom text

means

Australia is even more messy because

they move in the other direction

though now I have it cooked uh

so back here

this is the current so yes

now I need to place them plus the place

the cook mesh here

which I can do by simply

a locating the cooked mesh

it's too exciting I don't have this one

but

basically new in the maritime

yes I have to free on it every time

this was a sing sing yeah I was messing

up it was Ling Ling I was working on so

similar names

this one

place them check that the time is

updated that took 30 minutes to create

I'm working kind of slow at the same

time

I'm working slower on stream now that

I'm off stream

and of course I can edit this one if I

choose State update version number

adding that version then starting the

game

and I need

to use

the bathroom is that what you say

spell

because they will

listen half an hour until the end break

anyway so I was thinking about polygame

standing up I need to

take a much

it is a very important Bridge I will

simply run the three minutes ads so

hopefully that will be one and a half

hour at free watching after it

so while I'm not being able to do

anything

be back in three minutes

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

you are welcome

is it myself no I don't have to browser

open

so

now if everything is correct

my address to have to think each other

whatever yes as expected that would mean

one and a half hours of ad free watching

and that's what we like

that's free watching

so

hopefully

it works as expected now

otherwise I will be sad

it's still broken

oh yeah

I need to

that was Charlie

but still

I should probably

using the free camera but is 53 is a bit

of a mess

say this

maybe this is just how broken it is

but this one is definitely broken this

is not how it's positioned

I don't know if she's more broken now or

not

[Music]

oh yeah it doesn't even have

oh yeah

okay

and back to

back to modding

a hide the window

oh yeah and I'm real back stay here

so

so this part can animate

spark and animate

but because this one doesn't have

basically this bone took all the

animation that The Sandbar should have

taken care of

so that's why it is broken

so I should see if I can

correct this

by

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

I'm guessing is a quite fun time because

I

don't wait

foreign

[Music]

again

[Music]

[Music]

it is floating

then I will keep this part of the body

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

places

[Music]

quickly

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

I didn't even make sure that this person

keeps record

silly

yeah

[Music]

yeah I can't

delete

and find out

I just have to check back

[Music]

or disaster with head one

[Music]

is that upper head lower than what

there is no head to one

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

just to make sure I get everything right

let me do that

[Music]

[Music]

hello

interesting first message

[Music]

I'm back

you're back

welcome kitten

[Music]

I have some ideas of how I should sleep

so what I would do

is that I win

conversation and doctor hopefully

wait which father is seducing now

wait wait right here

good

[Music]

so

I am exported since which is what I need

so and which other ones are do I need to

export

Connecticut

[Music]

boys

[Music]

sunny next modeling Ling we'll have that

upper body

so let me take care of that

thank you

[Music]

and that's a

cms3205 ago

sport

and that's done

and then

he works too that doesn't matter

and then lay for the lower body

which is

yes three two oh one

finally

this is so smart I mean

yes maybe

[Music]

there's something simple

conclusions

and fruit kit

to that important thing

[Music]

so this would work as the basis for the

[Music]

everything

and then I would import

drinking

for the upper body

yeah see very important thing it doesn't

have on the

on the bones down there for some reason

most of us are there not elephants

some reason

did I miss anything when I was gone I

mean I guess you missed that I still

haven't been able to get this to work

and then lay

put a little body

there you go

no I don't need the skeleton from today

or Ling Ling because those are broken

you can do it yourself smart we'll see

we'll see about that

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

shouldn't be yeah

[Music]

the Armature at the same time which I

don't want

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

got everything

so I don't need that part

and then I don't need everything here

that is duplicated

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

um this stuff

is that

so that's most of the body which is

handled by the mesh that actually

belongs to the skeleton this is just

expand it

[Music]

and this is for the 500 parts that I

don't

[Music]

know

he looks a cute State they do look cute

I said I wouldn't mind a panda like this

to Colony

this is some overlapping here

no it isn't it's never let me get out

here okay

thank you

two times I don't even

[Music]

double up on the lake South Africa no

there's no more doubling up

[Music]

thank you

so that should be in one part

let's increase the tanks around me okay

now all the parts should be separates

now to see if everything works perfectly

accordingly

so I'm sure you said correctly

so this is what the right YouTube please

should look like

professionalism

this one has more

it doesn't have a bone for that

this is

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

okay

[Music]

it has even more extra

okay it does have head one

for some reason

[Music]

somewhere at least

it was like

top lower

[Music]

heads without a y

I want the panda plus like this now

yeah they're so thick they would be but

they need so much stuff you can be so

soft be perfect

for cuddling

I don't know

it should be there apparently

[Music]

[Music]

oh

[Music]

my God

they basically got extra eyelid Parts

here

so cute

so

AP and dish

I want to say five more for some reason

I can do that

[Music]

bye

or

and then it should be right

bye

[Music]

problem is with thunder is that you

cannot simply move you cannot select

both of this and we'll go to connect

thank you

all you can do this

it is tea yes

indeed

hydrate

[Music]

oh hydrate

a cute

[Music]

you know what's cute the sporty outfit

for one pot

[Music]

on our particular reason

[Music]

good idea

[Music]

yeah yeah look at that

and now you can enjoy this sporty

pampone in even a high quality because

since I increased the string quality

if you're watching in

yeah like 7 20 which I'm streaming

so cute

fun fun is also white like in his pandas

thank you

friends at that time to see

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

again at the Romantic script Corrections

[Music]

right

I guess we've got to see head accessory

one

[Music]

oh it is down there just a different

order

that one

another way to search things is to do

this this

join

glasses

stay alone

the class is this one

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

than it is sinking

so if I re-import name

[Music]

[Music]

there we go

this seems to be more correct

for some reason

[Music]

[Music]

company is a kid I would like a full

picture

I can maybe yeah if I started this

course it's a survey

I can start a Discord server and then I

can

add that to

at least

[Music]

you like some

um Channel

full I guess

you know different outfits

[Music]

I am thinking

[Music]

[Music]

what part is

five nights

and what's this part

which for some reason

it's broken on this

[Music]

yes there's nothing on this one

but this one has at least this proteins

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

I don't use the facing music

but I like

yeah I'm at enemy

[Music]

it's I'm keeping eye we need to do I

guess that would be good super like a

drawing a lot and stuff

[Music]

which can be showcased on the survey

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

so I can apply

my mirror

I guess I'm kind of blocking to pee

there but

apply

people like to see the big punto so

it doesn't matter what the setting say

right

as long as you have the big one

set up click

click okay now this is correct

[Music]

thank you

so I don't need that yeah it does this

because they are excited Richard kit kit

to delete old ones

and then merge the new ones

so new eyelids

or the panda

I hope you are happy

[Music]

you're so nice that's that's nice to

hear thank you for your compliments

I

bacteria

already I don't know my messages now

didn't expect these pandas to cost me so

much trouble delete old ones

thank you

okay and then I can

shut up

and then I go to pandas and then I find

Ling Ling

put here

input screen looks fine

[Music]

and

they can

things have arrived

we'll start to the corresponding phone

days

I think for it to move

picture is taking a while

moving the second one

it became really slow how a sudden

and now it's done

I'm gonna make the texture

and that was quick here

I don't know why the tail stick so much

long time now

[Music]

foreign

names

we saw three directors

cook

[Music]

and that was a lot of messing around

or something I don't even know if it's

good question

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

and it is

[Music]

for some reason I have something weird

thank you

anyway it is still cooking

sounds like it was part of the song

itself in that case it's a little bit

hard on the stream as well but

but

[Music]

we can complete you know what that means

the date is latest paying the time

it is indeed

time to see a broken bed

is the new version

launch the game

and while it's starting up I should get

any piece of bread to eat

basically take

a minute or two eating time

so because

then like a quarter until the eggs but

if I play it I mean that means that the

next break will be two minutes instead

of spirits that's not a good idea

so I will take me to probably gym in

some way

thank you

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

if the game started

okay

game has that

it is showing the wrong View

oh that's awesome

that is correctly

I didn't get my headset

and let's see if the panels are still

broken

it's just the eyelids

online fixing

hopefully it will work

no it's broken

it is broken

why is it broken

it doesn't blink with my name

is

I want to like capture the blinking

yeah it's completely messed up now

uh I don't know what time what's

happening

camera represent the

yep

remember I mean okay

a bad reaction time

in the case but yeah it's the basic

bunched up for some reason

and I'll say it's broken

foreign

okay there we go finally

after many attempts so this is obviously

how the irony should look

this is how the eyelid looks when it's

broken

and it's broken indeed

completely messed up

so

I can of course remove the eyelids so

there's no more blinking but

I obviously don't want to do that

foreign

anyway

and I don't even know why it breakups

like this

and I

inside the head okay that's good again

I was doing that thing and

I think

back to blender

hello this girl do you love cheese

it's not easy I'm just showing you what

she looks like there's no teasing at all

I see

yeah that's good

it's the blending separate from rest I

don't know

where's the music

half the time I'm gonna press up simple

split it doesn't work

I mean here it looks perfectly fine

foreign

but

it does have audacious like

dates which I don't think happens in

Game

but

the eyelids are working perfectly here

but then when I export them it's broken

but it can be at this

there is one solution although I didn't

of course would that happen with the

eyebrows

but this one one idea which could work

It Is by exporting the animations as

well

it's a slow process

but it should work

so if I import all these animations

and it's importing it is not click

and while it's important we can go to

Angry end

and here we need a folder called

animations

because unsurprisingly the animations go

in the animations folder

okay anyway

that's either that

ignore it that thing that just happened

it didn't happen

anyway panda

animations

it's like a global scene

export the export might take a while

but the input was really quick

[Music]

I was playing this song If it is not

this song this music for the total

amount of music is three hours 45

minutes

I was playing everything quite the long

strings

it would be the longest stream I've ever

done

nothing he watches

with like a two hour silence in the

beginning but let's eat it

[Music]

it's nice it is nice it's working to me

on Discord I really should create a

Discord server for my

yeah I I need that is good sorry

[Music]

the beginning I'm sorry I should tell

you about the sound sorry

and yeah it's fine it's fine

I'm still

I'm still more like myself like

okay I must Miss such a detail

foreign

so what we do now

[Music]

to make this work

is that

we go to resources get the animations

import the animations to the animation

folder

and the pop-up is not showing as

expected

all right that's it okay

so we select the skeleton we want the

animations to be on and I just realized

they I exported it in correct

implantation

yes it is

frames per second

I had to export it again

next because games game is running in 30

frames per second

I have set blender to default this at

frames per second just because of my own

convenience but when the important

animation it resets it back to 24 frames

indeed now I have a bit more writing

and a tough waiting

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

anyway here the

unreal view is big

this is Dark Hollow early stereo meets

how different is this items

still exporting

[Music]

practice now

waiting of the export

anyone who is in this

watching at the moment can write in a

chat saying something funny

something funny

right

[Music]

and yeah as expected

but these are very cute that is very

funny

this is very funny

thank you

and I said apparently stream it's 25

frames second

I forgot to set it over two seconds

to keep track of and now I say I cannot

change that now

I'm pretty sure

it's locked

oh well it doesn't matter

under the animation what the gift should

be more correct at 25 because

ifs only work on it oh it's done by the

way it gives only works in multiples of

hundreds so you can have it in

porting you can have it in 100 frames

second

50

33 and a third

25

20 and so on

while 24 30 and 60 frames a second for

gifts are not available

and setting a few of them to 1 100 of a

second

that will actually equal to 60 frames

per second

but that they would result in a battery

animation

lafarian thank you for

an amazing

Prime subscription especially don't know

what exactly that means

take my Prime serve more now I want to

react it what is the reject buttons

so it counts as two subscriptions

yeah I don't know what

rhyme means you're a prime gaming

oh my

YouTube get access to the

two one point notes

there will be more

hopefully

there will be more yeah this is a slow

process of and that's why I wanted to

avoid doing the animation Parts but

because the animation is 14 so slow

yeah I have been talking to an artist

who said he could

do it

on the 20th

and that doesn't mean that actually will

happen because there is no Like Anything

could happen maybe he's busy then in

that case

so

so we'll see if because we have not not

made any official agreement

and so but hopefully hopefully there

will be made

some nice ones with different actual

different emotions and not just blank

staring

I don't even know how I would describe

this Pom-Pom motion

the chest

Bang

you don't see it now it just sets top

files

need good fun fun thank you

it's not what I wanted like

the pictures you have

a bit more

expressive but that's what more and more

time after

yeah still waiting for the for the

importing

and the basic is playing in the

background

and it says the music down in the corner

as best as I could do it

it's not like get contrast but

it's not really a highlight it's cheap

here's some background music

but it isn't quite

ah it is done as you see a lot of files

showed up

and the music disappear

now

this which is the least

so what this does is that it replaced

for some reason

I think

yeah exactly because we've got the

normal ones and then it's got the

duplicate ones which is armature first

so half of this egg goodbye

usually because it double stem out of a

more time because it I think

it double simple time

because it basically puts everything

twice

and I don't know how to fix that it just

does that

actually I do think there's one way to

fix that that is if I import one

animation export that from lender and

then import that it doesn't make it a

duplicate as far as I know but that's of

course a much tedious way to do it so

having it just import it for twice as

long

it's fine

the amount of time it takes for me to

input one dimension and Export that

compared to the time it takes for it for

a really important animation twice

I think it will take more thank you for

me to do it manually

but I'm trying to say

and that's all the animations

sadly

that is not all the animations

if only

if only that was all animations

you sound super smart

thank you I just I don't know

it's just stuff I've learned during this

I guess

and may not able to

fix the issue itself doesn't make me

sometimes

I don't know how I should fix this

animation here because you sound smart

I don't know I know that's not what you

mean

it sounded very funny

raise it like that

I know you have good intentions

[Music]

but it didn't give up your smart

forgiving detects yeah try to like go

through the process like

basically mostly maybe for myself so I

know what I'm doing

and it has helped me when I describe

things I noticed that up wait I missed

that or that doesn't make sense how does

this work actually

that that helps

and other people might be curious

because I mean

I have to say something

but of course you have free to write in

the chat so you can

need to say things to you

because you might like that

if you like me talking to you

[Music]

and I hope the quality is better

and bye

[Music]

[Music]

American report is

foreign

I guess if it's

now it's going to verify the redeems but

for some reason

I can apparently report redeems my own

redeems but it's not my only it's your

doing three teams this doesn't make

sense to me if it's a text input that

makes sense and now I got some

persons showing up here if you might if

I might recognize

happy birthday thank you Willis very

nice to see you okay

very I'm very happy to see you

I'm currently

modifying

upena

in a slow slow process

I just uh

so now

is some speaking area

and it is

but it's still if I had said it it

started before importing it will still

provide it back to

is this like a

collect overbite

so

export this

panamations this is by the lip sync

oh wait that was what I was going to

look up

if I go to import again

yes I wanted to copy the folder name

which doesn't show up the screen

see I'm wondering what I'm doing

sometimes

and now

can export these

and I'll switch back to Adrian

welcome yes uh oh I see you're doing

some blender blender and Maria I started

last week and it's still coffee thing

understandable

it just started with modeling

modeling modeling it is confusing

something can be very confusing

but as soon as you get hang of stuff it

is very easy

at least I mean I mean depending what

you do something's not easy something is

a hard currently I struggle with making

the eyelid for the panda work properly

that has nothing to do with blending

that's just how the eyelid Works in game

and I just can't get it to work

no it's fun it can be fun if you enjoyed

3D modeling

I did a lot of 3D modeling one

several years ago and I think that has

helped me

and modding now respite

select animation stuff currently

currently a when you want to mod

inspiring I did

you have basically

you have basically three outcomes I

would say

you can

import automation export it and replace

the mesh only and everything just works

like for spiral for some reason even the

Aspire is a very complex character you

can just export the mesh and it just

works and but for some directors

this doesn't work

you import and

mesh and stuff and it's broken it's it's

mostly works but it's still broken and

then you have stuff that just doesn't

work down

in school I did do the modeling but went

with students

whenever you have the opportunities

plan to still exporting

the exporting process is quite slow

for the animations if you have to export

a mesh it's fine this is why I want to

avoid doing animations

but it doesn't give me much of a choice

[Music]

so I guess that's the boring part of the

stream nothing is happening the feel

free to write in the chat because

yeah nothing's happening

while I'm waiting for blender to do its

stuff

and as soon as plenty stand

I'm going to import it to Unreal and

then do I have to wait for unreal to be

done

so

slow process

the next and this is exactly why I want

to avoid messing with animations

but it looks like I have to do it this

time

which is a shame because not only

not only is this this is a very slow and

slow process which I there is nothing

for me to do at the moment

and it makes the modifier larger which

is also not preferable

but oh well

but if you do want to modify the

animations let's

that also comes in three miles I guess

for example when I modified one NPC

but you just import the animations to

unreally modify the animations I didn't

modify it well I did a certain type of

modification

so that worked perfectly fine but for

another character when I did the

animations it broke the characters I had

to include the skeleton I usually don't

disable space

it makes more sense if you're

mathematics

I'm just trying to feel space at moment

when I'm waiting for blending

in a third type is for examples this

spiral which is completely character if

I try to modify or work with those

animations the animations

the animation work but

the some animation specifically

so-called blend spaces what they call it

they have issues with scale

and so when they do this blending which

I assume they do

um

the scale of the character gets

different success

and it ruins everything

so I cannot even modify the animations

for Spyro

but luckily just replacing the edge

works perfectly fine

it is weird

why is it still work

it's not that

I guess the I mean yeah I guess I guess

the lip sync animations are longer and

many more so

so the spider music server

so much knowledge

in this field I modify stupid

that's a bit complicated it's

not really I mean it's very

straightforward when you are modding

because it's basically just doing the

same thing

it's just more knowing what to do

oh it looks like to understand

now it's not I got food

so now I got a non-inspiring music

this is the main thing for a game

[Music]

which game is it

[Music]

anyway

I do have all of the music from that

gaming playlist

just to fill out the

[Music]

second I'm gonna have to physics stuff

but I can't sing I don't know if I can

sing I'm not going to try to sing at the

moment

experience but I have considered if I

should because I have a Rock Band 3

specifically

obviously it has a lot of copyrighted

music I cannot stream that

but what I was considering doing is

finding people who has done covers of

those songs

and then instead of playing the game

audio I'm playing the actual cover

which obviously is unattractive so I

need to like

normally they want like go after me for

Richmond for their covers

but

it means technically still incorporate

but anyway so the idea is that I tried

that and then I shouldn't do like

karaoke on that

and then I go and

humiliate myself and stream or something

the hot coffee thing is really annoying

I mean

I mean

I am not here to argue one way or

another but

[Music]

okay

finally Blended it's done

so next step

importing them

200

which is going to be a pop-up so let's

go to the shower on Steam

Okay so

while this is doing its tedious

importing

and twitch wants to play another ad

so why don't we do that

and I

go to the bathroom again

which sounds good to me at least

I'll see you later

in like three minutes

I have problems in three minutes we'll

see

hope to misbehave no then you'll get

banned

pumpkin is still here

unfancy everything with you

foreign

wait a minute what's going on here

I am being

as I've forgot to read this message for

my kitty kitten with a kitty kitten you

have a beautiful voice I would love to

hear you sing one day

yeah I don't have a single myself

but

myself

thank you for I think that I have a

beautiful voice

I'm

I don't know

against misbehave now meow meow meow

meow meow

that's misbehavior

able to flipping I wasn't misbehaving I

was a kid

this is it this is meow

on a bunny stream

now

I'm going to

do something

[Music]

hang out

wait what did that show up

Now isn't it

[Music]

[Music]

yeah

uh Discord server

but would that be called when upon

abundant

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

sneaking around over there too I'm just

here to pick up a cat

the rest of the chat don't bring me

I do definitely have enough of that

I think the middle part

you can apparently don't make it like

however long you want because it's not

looping

[Music]

and then apparently I can pay for it

I guess it's resetting the timer in that

case

anyway

let me

see the whole careful to get there

there now he twice

[Music]

it didn't like it but only but now the

whole thing is that

cute pink kitten

it is

a long kitten

it is a bigger nut

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

twitch as the spaces between them

I do like it better in any way

okay Discord helps it

foreign

[Music]

waiting for the animations to load into

unreality hopefully see a fully working

panda in the end

but if this is working we're going to

see a fully working patient answer I

guess it's

that's going to be exciting

exciting indeed also

thank you

but maybe maybe I wasn't paying

attention anyway yeah ignoring that

while we're waiting

and here's the schedule

apparently

I have a

basically stuck to doing a racing games

on Monday Tuesday

so the next coming upcoming Monday and

Tuesday which you can see the times

there

am I so sweet what

are you kidding

do you know it's you are and not you are

one year but

anyway you're here's a sweet one thank

you

except for the times when I believe your

spelling but

so next Monday Tuesday will be the

racing game that I've been waiting today

and you will be

it will be exciting to see that one

I hope

it's still importing so I still have

more time

Thursday Friday has become spiral time

I'm sorry I forget see your and you are

mixed up

yeah deleted your keep your only

I know it's happened to meet you

you should be my English teacher

I will be your Swedish teacher

so I'll search them Friday I will try to

do Legends of Spyro

maybe that one will work better

my phone is at Spanish

exciting

my phone is such a Swedish

oh it's such a surprise anyway

and then Saturday Sunday

it's like other games I guess

yeah so so anyway Legends probably

should hopefully run better than into

dragonfly but just entered the fly just

doesn't run basically at all and they

a hairstyle I'm not going to be able to

play that because they have switched

around the controls for some

stupid reason

and it's not like an amazing good game

it's not like Legend at the age of space

such an amazing game series either but

I haven't really played through the

whole series so

I've been loving YouTube videos

are you in pain

and Saturday Sunday will be random games

and the next upcoming Saturday so this

Sunday will be no stream because this is

like this this Sunday this Saturday is

like both days combined

for five hours it's like four and a half

hours so far

so the total amount of 12 hours is

definitely

compensate for it I hope

but

next week Saturday Sunday

we mean

a dog's life

which I know at least one person is

excited to see

so we will see how that gets

and also

that depends on the game how do is there

an easy way to check like the frame rate

of games

because I want to stream in the frame

rate of the game of course

I wonder who

uh it's someone it wasn't you but if you

are also excited in that case I mean you

are excited for every team I do so I

didn't really consider you in that way

that was like automatic obvious that you

would be excited

but I mean specifically that game

and my headphones are

slipping away

not that

not that I need them but this music I

want to be with him

oh my

God is it done

is important

yeah in Europe Western time is UK time

not sure why you can use those and call

it Western time

because it's the same

it would make things easier

you can check frame rates by using

Windows game no wait no no I meant

when I'm playing

when I'm playing on PlayStation 2 games

because of if I'm playing a PC game I

can often just go to the settings and

check the information from there

so that's no problem

when the computer games usually are I

mean like the games I play are usually

60 so

I know there are like develops as you

want likes divorce like 30 for a

movie like experience which is just

silly

but

I don't play those games

what would be easy if is if we use magic

why I'm at

um yeah I mean there's been like

because I have much so many team

this this one YouTube I watched who

basically said who is from United States

and I said that everyone should just use

metric it would make it so much easier

and sure that's uh that would make it

easier but then when he makes videos he

constantly don't use magic when he says

Aldi stuff it's one thing if it likes if

he reads that text and it's not using

materials I mean converting it would

take extra effort but sometimes you have

both units there and he doesn't read the

magic unit

so he is failing at making people

comparative to Magic

and the

considering like

I tried to look at it obviously depends

on what your demographic is on YouTube

but the demographic on YouTube in

general isn't like 80 of

70 80 of those who've watched YouTube

across all channels

a use metric or something like that so

it's still like the

it's at least a major majority at least

that's but of course it depends on your

audience

I will use battery it makes it makes it

so much easier

still importing

it it doesn't say which one is important

it's just that it's importing one of the

animations moment which is also annoying

were they still working so

it's still more waiting

no more Fitness yeah why would you match

it imagine measuring yourself in your

own feet that would be something

foreign

about that by basically describing what

my own height is in the Swedish foot

which is a unit

so uh

well I'm still waiting for this at least

it's still working that's the important

part

so well let's let's look things up then

yep

one Swedish foot is

Twilight is six White

five millimeters I take that one thing

too many

so

what is it there you go

which means that one Swedish we call it

thumb but it's basically inch and in

inches we call sums in Sweden anime

which would be 29 wait right six

minutes

so if we take my height which is

registered at 180 centimeters

so we take that divided by

21.685 we get it I am

six

beat

average one in Swedish another one

yeah the the Swedish word for

just

term is yeah

and almost

one

of them

there we go

that's of course not my height if you

want to use the English units

but

it cares about this

I like because that's kind of the

situation here

I'm from Sweden my people

out of not their own choice that we can

afford to and I wouldn't do it on their

own so they were first to

but later generations like myself are

happy for it so

sometimes you have to do sacrifices so

there was I had a second in sacrifice

and forced himself to use metric

and then and so we came up on our units

and we use metric now and then we have

these English people who haven't given

up on their units and then they cut and

then some of those people

not not any majority or anything and

it's not only English people you have

people a few people in some places like

United States and Canada too who then

tell me that I should learn their units

no I I I don't want no

and I have given up on my you know I

didn't use that was my previous

generation but my people have given up

on our units in favor of metric your

people should give up on your units in

favor of magic and then we unify with

metrics I have I have taken my part on

my people that have done that

your your people has has have to do it

too

so

and I think that would be fair

metric

especially since a lot of people around

the world like the German people that's

given up on their units the French

people have given up on their units

Spanish people have given up in their

units

the English people are not in any way

special I'm not going just like I didn't

learn the German uni sorry French units

I'm not going to learn the English units

I just can't bother doing it that's more

like I'm too lazy

that's actually

it's more like the actually somebody's

asking this uh

this this like there's no point of me

doing it because I never use it in my

daily life

yes that's the second reason

so that's that's the history behind that

anyway

oh this dream is kind of going red there

all of a sudden now it's finally done

which should have shown up and oh sorry

switching back there you go that's

animation since I sound finally

important

I don't think they tried it here in 1970

Buffet because the other the word

optional yeah that's that yeah that was

kinda what I mentioned there that the

Swedish people didn't have an option

it was you have to do it

[Music]

or

well it's a crime if you don't

and that's kind of like how you do it

and it's not like

and then and and it was uh to ensure

that trade and such became

so many of these

uh understood by everyone

because you cannot have a unit that

everyone is calling foot and then that

unit is different in every reach he

cooked it's just such a mess

[Music]

as to be expected

because I I can

I can expect to keep on saying things

like

I should have the freedom to use

whatever units I want well you can do it

in your private life but when it comes

to

um

advertising when it comes to product

measurements and stuff like that you

need a standard system

especially consider our world being

International we send products all over

the world a major submitted everywhere

you go

and people should not be able to

cheat to the system by using one unit

one people think is a different unit

and there are other so even if you live

in a country that are using the English

units

you are still restricted for what you

can do when it comes products you still

have to follow you can use you're still

you are still limited by the official

units that the country of considers

official and you are forced to use those

units

they are not you still don't have your

freedom

that you in that you in this case refers

to these people I

still being forces metric

in marketing

it's just reducing the number of units

that appear but I mean I'm pretty sure

not exactly the truth because if you

always are already using National beans

but it's for international Unity that's

the

but anyway

time is over

we got the extra switch time we got

something

a slow process so anything else

interesting going on

this is SpongeBob's around time

I just try to be fair

and I think I'd try to look at things to

objects in the end logically

and it doesn't mean I I always succeed

and I do miss certain details

of course big storm come my way I hope

you

are safe it's not like a tornado or

anything

it's just

hopefully only heavy rain

do you have more details to give

how do you save

will you be safe

I guess is there a better question

rain is there heavy rain

that should be fine right

I don't know

[Music]

anyway cooking all the animations

and then I would have to include on the

animations

and the skeleton

it never tested that that's a bit silly

of me

what if that's all I have to do but in

that case I should still include all the

animations just in case to make sure

that the mesh

to ensure that the

what am I think

to ensure that the mod is stable okay

that's what I was talking about

I will be safe it doesn't flood here

we have a river near by to move the

water out yeah that makes sense

so yeah that's that's good

good

no flooding

but no flooding No Cry

I guess this is a choice

[Music]

basically I made a

version here where I just override the

skeleton from the game

but keeping the original animations

this could have two results

it could either just work as expected

and everything is good or it could

completely break the mesh it's not going

to play the game

but the mesh bite is looking messed up

obviously let's say meshed up

[Music]

that was important

but I'm going to let it

cook

without cooking

before I start the game

[Music]

really because now I have

[Music]

yeah

I'll just get the information about

trying to turn this off

still a cute plan first one

if you fall behind on if you notice that

if you send a message that it takes time

for you to show up on screen

and if you on the

only if you're on a mobile you can't

actually do it if you don't dance it up

at the moment and you're watching the

stream and feel like when someone's not

sending a message in the chat

and it takes a while before it shows up

on screen now it's done cooking so

in that case

start start by a desktop we press on the

Cog wheel

and that was the end of the song Just

abruptly ended

so you press on the card wheel

press on advanced

and then there is an option that says

low

latency you disable it and enable it

doesn't matter how quickly disable

enable it

maybe that not too quick maybe it's like

click click should be enough

and that will update it and it will

be now in sync it would be nice if there

was a quick

sync up button

but in that case you don't have to

refresh the whole page that should

sync it up a bit quicker you're still

missing a part of the stream depending

how far behind you are

and on mobile

well there is no such nice option

assembly

and I should start the game by the way

since the cooking is done if I go to

tweets

and then I

go to

bandan

this streaming with four viewers at the

moment and doing a special event

I am the important phone is playing on

you

and then you press on the Cog wheel here

there's sadly no option to change the

low latency option but what you can do

is you can change the quality

so if you look watching Source quality

can just switch between one of the two

20p versions

or you can switch or if you want if

there's only like a specific quality you

want to watch if you want to watch 480

for example you have to change it to a

different one and then change it back

not super convenient but

and it's starting to roll

there you go

that's how I keep it up

and again it would be really nice if the

mobile version similarly had a button

you can just press to make it sync up

and also we could if a

twitch could have some kind of automatic

system we trusted of that

but like if you fall behind

it will try to speed up the stream to

slightly to make you catch up not enough

that you should notice it

but just a slight speed increase

an idea

so people don't fall behind

so that some tricks you can use and now

let's see

is this no it's still broken

yep

do that animation again

not that one the other one

any

I guess I could okay

flying straight through the body and

okay

I wish I was just the animations that

choose to do I will try not accept that

one okay

and after the I didn't mentions oh well

what are you waiting for

flaming your back

now don't rotate the camera

why aren't you playing your idol

animation 07

what are you doing

don't do anything

okay finally

the hand still she might walk away

my back is getting really hot okay as it

might be hard to see but yeah this this

whole thing here is the eyelid and it's

it's pushed back and

rushed up and I have no idea what's

going on with that eyelid

this eyelid perfect

but not the other one

yeah

a bit drank Maybe

so I still got things to do

fun panda

so what I'm trying to do now

now I will take the

animations

sir

so

I would copy the animations from

the whole animations from that I hope

it's quite this boat

and put it in the mod folder

wait this will be inside the content

mesh perfect

and back here

should never do a new version

I should do new version so I can compare

how

not just find size differences

yeah

so if I add the skeleton that's like

adding nine kilobytes but if I add

if I add all the animations it has three

thousand

you have it

17.

8

anyway

I will be back guys to get some food oh

it sounds tasty actually makes my

Samsung should

keep up some

chicken or something

that would take away

so

I should have had some

something else to eat

cute

I even eat meat

huge

if you say so

the game is starting up the game cam

Islam you know what means

I don't know what mean okay

or or or maybe you said you know what

mean

but I don't think that's what the

intended to say

or was it

you know what I mean I'm sorry

[Music]

actually I'm a bit confused I don't know

actually

[Music]

anyway uh still wrong with you always

around me

here we go there's the game

and with all the animations added

I've been at this for five hours now

come on now my name can be slow

I will be back okay

good luck with that

see how

look

it depend that it's working

he sent a panda beautiful

and then it plays an ideal animation and

everything breaks

play an animation

like should I trigger something

okay the lip sync is working

but why aren't you playing any

animations

chosen to use the exclamation point

for the interaction

because if you're playing on Xbox

controller which is not connected at the

moment

because I'm lazy as we have established

on this stream and they are using the Y

button they have a special 3D model for

that

and if you're using the PlayStation

controller

and that is not an option and

um

PC but they have still have that 3D

models which they're using 15 in the

places version of the game and if you're

playing on switch which there are still

places of files on the PC version

and then they must have added then

because the switch version but whatever

and the switch version have a 3D model

for x button for the infraction

this band is really not playing and it's

Island dimensions

well uh you know what you I will go to

the other pandas because these Palace

all right

are also using because they're using

exact same skeleton they're also use the

animation of Rights and the new skeleton

as far as I can tell everything is

working as intended

almost I mean the eyebrows since

a bit

connected to

try to get a close-up

anyway

everything seems to be working which is

important

so anyway as was going to say

uh

um on computer of course and you can

Define whichever key one like it says F4

interact if I go to

report controls just for fun and then I

press B

and now it will say

I have to interact because the game is

stupid

didn't I say

do I have to press save

okay update press save

and now it says b to interact

it's dynamically like that

but I don't think the interacting shows

up when you're on controller but but

what I'm trying to say here is that

of course the

the

app

of course the first

counter question to that would be

wouldn't they have to create a letter

for every letter possible to place over

their head in that case

when they already have that they already

have every letter from a through Zed

including additional letters like the

three letters in the Swedish alphabet

because this is our first thing you can

do if you go to controls

not control scheme keyboard controls and

then I can press this Swedish key there

we go and now it says ER

and it says ER to interact

Earth interacts

so

that's support for that too

uh

so then because they have support for

all kind of letters depending on what

keyword you have they have these letters

available for this thing that shows up

over the head they just didn't do it for

some reason ah look at this lag

I just

want to make sure that like

uh

and now

now they're broken

they are

they are

they are horrifying

what's wrong with your face

don't look at him

perfect

they are amazing

look at this beautiful flower because

that's the of the biggest issue it is

that must mean that

yeah yeah the uh the yeah yeah

the animations for

the totem phone thing is placing the

difference folder

[Music]

I think now

that means

foreign

what I have to do is basically look for

this animation now animations there

it should probably be placed in the

folder of one of those pandas that are

doing that bone

but I don't know what their names are

because you can't ask talk to them while

they're standing there

it's obviously not be lingling that's

that's the panda at the start but I had

to check just in case

should we sing sing

because here is the regular ones without

already included

now here Panda stack

admit

I don't think could it treat us properly

yeah they are here

[Music]

that's why are they broken

why if you look broken here

yep of course you can't see because it's

probably no there you go

they are already broken here

why why

are they broken

this is supposed to be how they look

I at least the eyelids are working

but why did this happened

and wise

that polygon out of

points incorrectly

[Music]

well

so everything

so it's actually correctly

displaying everything in the game it's

just that it was incorrect when it got

imported to blend it

how

perfect

so let's switch over to blending

because so far everything is working

so

now

I will import that one of those

animations only

which I do from here

disable that hey ponpon happy birthday

hello

Miss Kitty core

why do you wait

you are from

I don't remember

I've been on too many streams

which other stream

have I seen yawn I mean you might not

remember which other things you have

seen may have to be fair

and I'm also very bad with names so

we use the pumping each other

that's it

yes now it makes sense

it was it was fun after like me yeah

that makes sense

yeah because I try to also interact

a bit

with the other uses because it's fun

look at this terrible panda

that have happened to your face that

since why is this happening

this is looking terrible I think you

should

[Music]

sneak attack or something

because this doesn't look healthy

it's like

[Music]

no it's not that it's like it's not skin

just it's just wrong

how old are you in one years I don't

know I I don't know

and I

yeah

okay I can't read polish

so I cannot help you

[Music]

I know he are but

sorry I can't make that awkward

oh it's time what why is this happening

and also

smooth teeth

yep I'm back from the story

welcome back from the story

and I have this horrifying Panda here

it's basically like everything is

stretched out for some reason

[Music]

why is that the kids

but keeps everything stretched out

[Music]

like this is normal

but it does this

why what

this is like the Titan screen from Super

Mario 64 that lets you mess with his

face

I mean yeah yeah

um

yeah that's that's kind of

what animation is

so

I have one idea

[Music]

what part is

okay here's that yeah

I will go and export

the uh

animations again but I will do but only

that specific one because they will

start working perfectly fine

oh I need to copy it passes because

humor all the perfect software which I

mentioned before I like to rent on it

it's so nice that it doesn't want to

save the path you're working and working

on

and then it's always defaults to the

path of where you have put your model

because of course I would put you more

than the one I use for multiple games in

the folder of the game

don't put random fans in the corner of

the game

[Music]

now wait a minute I can't export because

I still have the more mod loaded

because obviously

course it's loading the mod files as

well

[Music]

second I can

learn out run the mods

[Music]

then I can read the game files

[Music]

itself and then I locate the character

which has the animations

BC

what's the name of this one or it

doesn't say

this one on screen

it's one of these

it's not lingling it's singing

there we go

London animations

[Music]

so

support

expert outside

no in that case I win

myself a bit too much

thank you

and back down

so there you go

those faces look funny oh welcome

[Music]

I can't say

[Music]

I can't say that

I need I need to call you something else

[Music]

right now and I I never did wrong fight

I didn't know the new new exported file

so go here

export it

characters I could see things content

wait where's the animation

[Music]

[Music]

come to especially export animations

there's nothing here

okay

and that chains

I guess I have to use the other the

other version the latest version is hope

for that much because if I could export

animations

what am I supposed to give them

okay thank you

I went to a taco place and it wasn't

fake in fact because Taco Bell it was

real tacos I got my favorite tacos the

three pass

thank you

I should probably drink something

you can see

[Music]

as this program tries to export the

animations

[Music]

another bottle

yes hydrate

it's a two liter bottle now these are

two and a half liter bottle

I thought I've got four liters but I got

five liters

[Music]

speaking of that now I can't read it

properly with the attack place it wasn't

fake I could talk about

industrial attackers

I got my favorite tacos

tacos tacos

tripping on Packers

tacos

anyway

um

good pronunciation

I mean I'm basically Australian half

Swedish Fish

and that is working apparently

people say you have such good

I guess that is the benefit I'm now in

Swedish because I got like 17 different

vowels I can use

and I think the biggest difference

because I think is because people are so

used to English people speaking and when

English people speak they often add so

many diphthongs they use silent letters

and the pronunciation is way off

so that instead of so I would say tacos

but while an English speaker would say

tacos or something like that maybe I'm

not an English speaker so I wouldn't

pronounce it perfectly I liked her I

mean like perfectly according to an

English people person would speak that's

it but yeah

or like yeah

and words ending with e where the E

should be pronounced

or like air and I need an example for

that

where people say that

so either English people don't pronounce

the final air or if they do pronounce

the final air they pronounce it as a

instead and that's not great

or or e

so I need an example give me a Spanish

word that ends with e

which I can then use as an example

preferably a two simple words Maybe

Ali means

so I can't speak for other English

speakers everyone here knows Spanish

pronunciation here if they don't speak

Spanish

yeah yeah

that makes perfect sense and I would

assume

let's say to the Spanish-speaking water

they would be more familiar as well

especially considering the history

nursing

yeah there you go I've added that

instead of I guess it's not too bad

today it's more like a Verde but because

otherwise you should give two hours

two hours

uh yeah and when some of these people

nothing has a bird

in that case I understand that well you

have a good pronunciation

when it when they hear me saying that

very dead

it's not like super accurate but it's

certainly much better than dirt

or or the other way is saying a Verde or

Verdi those are also variance

nope it is broken

[Music]

is it supposed to be off the ground like

this

you have to seek a doctor for you need

some Exorcist

wait where's Kitty he speaks Spanish

natively

okay what happens

give me a moment

okay let me bring up this window on the

Stream

let me use

this program which are closed

there we go

now this is the program we can use

through the normalizing

[Music]

just cloudy eyes

[Music]

and so far this planet is perfect normal

animations that's how you know

animations

Papa doesn't show on screen

that was it like you could know that

window and have it include all the

pop-ups that we know that's related to

the minimum

oh no the panda has

cataract

I guess I

there we go

oh this is the climbing animation

look at those heads

then I

I don't stack

Jump Then

jump the jump start no it's just this is

just how it looks

I can't I can't do anything about this

then

it's broken

I am back I got the food

speaking of the Wolf

a cat okay

and there he is

that he is

speaking of the cat

isn't it speaking of the troll or

something I don't know I don't I don't

speak English

where's it well it's called lawn

one isn't even once

in Japan's face okay

well translated to English

nowadays they use the Polish phrase okay

when it doesn't look like

I can't do much about this

[Music]

and that's the thing

that's a real shame

I guess I have to add that to the list

of broken things

I need to clean out this

is

so because everything else seems to work

with the palette anyway

what I can do is I can

take these Pines

which I don't show in on the stream

because I'm working here sorry about

that again

delete them

I guess in Swedish they say speak of the

troll yep there you go that's the phrase

and as you speak of the devil oh that's

what it is I just yeah I knew it was

I knew what you said wasn't the English

phrase we just like the Polish friends

we just like the participants better

I used to move one before but never knew

English home oh it's probably similar in

Spanish in that case

should we do some research

if I go to

which I speak of the devil because this

is interesting

did I pack the new one

I did

about that I need to hydrate more

no one has redeemed hydrate

I will start the game

because an expression sometimes used

when a person mentioned in current

conversation happens to arrive on the

scene

and then we get translations from

different languages like Arabic

mention an absent person and you shall

see him that's a very obvious like to

wait too later on don't you have like

yeah

okay in the South levantine Arabic we

get the deceased man appears with the

mention of his name

that's that's some that's very

or we mentioned the cat and he came

jumping

while in azerbaijani it's name him

find him in the direction of which you

turn your ear

this sounds very it doesn't sound kind

of interesting in English obviously

better in in azerbaijani because in that

language

um

I of course cannot uh there's no

pronunciation

and foreign

[Music]

that's the best I can do that's the full

phrase and it's basically means the

whole English text

expression gets weird when you translate

them sometimes

and NASA all right thank you I can't

handle it again the first one was my

hydrates now I'll hydrate your hydrate

a sub kit wolves are fluffy and cute the

Wolves hunts in packs

why would they go in a packet hand you

should go into the Wildland hunt

and have a wild Hunt

why isn't it working

if you get the reference

I don't

get reference and it doesn't seem like

kitten gets referenced either because

you know the IC

y

considering I would assume you would

have written again

I get it I don't get it

that's an odd reference anyway moving on

so all these animations are of course

working because they are exactly the

same

I see I get it oh sorry you do get it

see I don't know apparently I don't get

it because I don't speak English so

what

wait wait what

what

I am very confused at the moment okay so

I have not overwritten these animations

obviously they're using the game

animations

why is the blinking animation working

obviously I'm happy that this is working

flawlessly but it shouldn't work privacy

because I have had so many issues before

but it's working now

do you know what you know what

I think I know

I think I know

yeah yeah I see what's going on

um

at this stacking panel stacking

animations they aren't animations I

think

because they have origin in the name

so it's not that

so it's not the yeah

it's not an animation and that's why a

human don't have issues with it the

Flawless new model

because it's not an animation it's just

the origin point for where they they

should stand

so they are animating like

inside the grass or something and then

with this origin offset they are placed

in the correct position

but they are playing

the regular animations from the other

animations which I have written with

this now working animations that

explains what everything is working so

that's hopefully it wasn't too technical

and you don't need to know every other

technical stuff anyway it's it's working

so I sure guess I should finish up this

month now and

according to the vote I held before

unless you want another vote

should I have a verb if I should have

something else because I got eight views

now welcome everyone it's beautiful

right or uh alert stay quiet or whatever

because lurking he's staying quiet if

you want that's very perfectly fine I

respect that

but yeah I would keep their heads

basically

aim and do

basically

let's use this camera

in Swedish it's

a very

in Polish it's

a village

in Spanish it's a lobo

or if you want the Loba

in German it's

a

wolf I think

wolf Maybe

unless he's a female

a female wolf in that case is a verified

there we go

and remember dolphin I cannot remember

wolf

the flower

is clipping through the body

and also the stem of the flower is

broken

is it supposed to be this this is broken

is this the case on every

song it does to have flowers

now this pen has gone away

and this pan is completely naked

okay

what are they talking about

anyway

so that means that

okay back here

go back here is the other hand open but

anyway that means I can delete these

origin stuff because

who cares about the origin

wolf yes you are

wolf

here we go

not the wolf but evolved if I would be

English revolved would be German my

pronunciation might might not be perfect

but you said yes I assuming this

question

oh my so so smart uh wait do you think

I'm smart again but I I just read what

you wrote

if you've played Skyrim that come

companions members who will pass and

parkas

or I should say

forecast

but I don't remember which languages

wilkas I don't know orkosh is Hungarian

and that's why it is not a farcas parkas

it is a forecast anyway

and he has sound smart fun fun I guess I

can pretend being smart I can I can give

this a smart Aura around myself and then

pretend I am intelligent while I'm

really stupid

anyway let's continue with this

uh where is the music

yeah good luck learning Hungarian

I wasn't

I have no intentions of learning

Hungarian

I've looked into it because I defined

language and big and stuff interesting

but the

that's about it

but these are the same

it is uh actually quite an interesting

language because it's quite a logical

language a lot of the

it's a lot of new words has been coined

and ins because basically instead of

taking existing words from other

languages a lot of

words has been coined for Hungarian

itself so if you want to take the word

grammar which is basically

they came from Greek meaning skilled in

writing

and which grammar is used in a lot of

languages like in Swedish it is

grammatic

in Spanish is grammatica

[Music]

my pronunciation isn't perfect

in Japanese

maybe not perfect but

[Music]

in polished is a grammatica

or gramatica anyway it's close enough

to get the point

but in Hungarian

it's

nielton

a completely different word because it's

combination of Niel which means language

and tan which means study

the study of Flesh

now because it says here that you also

there's just about the grammatica but it

is wasn't listed on the as a

presentation of grammar so

I don't know how common that word is

so

yeah

[Music]

let's do this Palace then

[Music]

because everything else is working and I

don't have the important anymore

animations

so I'm happy about that because this is

such a snow crisis

[Music]

so I will now export all these pandas

and write the correctly enabled I did

sorry about that

let's change clothes to your

did you know so much I was looking up

the actually I happen to know that so

yes

I but that's the thing about looking

stuff up like this

language is something I have been

interested in

I just like the

[Music]

um

energy and will to actually learn

languages which is a shame

because

I should have at least a knowledge about

languages if I don't learn these

languages

yeah

anyway

I'm currently exporting these pandas so

I can

important today in their editor

and as requested by the

[Music]

by the

[Music]

thing that's what I call it the pole the

things short of the pole

[Music]

and they will have their hats

[Music]

yeah that's my rapid

[Music]

then Lee

[Music]

doesn't have a hat

that will be exported

make it

kind of I guess

a lingling doesn't have anything and

then either

the glasses should I include the glasses

or not I don't know they didn't have

them in the original and basically

almost no characters in the game have

glasses and to be fair

people in real life do have glasses and

that needs to be normalized

[Music]

and the Trope of

uh I've seen it in a few films where I

basically have a woman wearing glasses

and then

the love interest takes off her glasses

and like oh you're so much more

beautiful

okay but now I can't see

I don't know it's kind of

looking down on glasses that kind of

trap

now like for a reason like that I don't

want to remove the glasses but in

traditional game didn't have them

literally the game didn't have these

hats either

but I do wear glasses when I

that's when I'm at my computer but

yes I I'm nearsighted

[Music]

he can cite me in there

I have glasses oh my sounds beautiful

beautiful oh my soul is beautiful wait

what sounds beautiful

the whole Trope about removing glasses

oh you look beautiful

that sounds like an insult and

the classes

people can be getting glasses

but of course it's like yeah

I mean honestly yeah I'm not personally

not a fan of glasses it's not like an

accessory it's not an accessory it's

it's

I wanted to look at it in a sense of

accessory in this case but it is it is

an aid

which people some people do need

a wheelchair an example

and it's not the necessary

it should not be considered an accessory

in that sense

what is a person

I don't know is that it's a it's a

complicated topic like

I need glasses I'm still not a fan of

classic sick

but it's not that it's not enough it's

not a thing of opinion or like

but I I haven't wondered if yeah I mean

there are nice looking glasses

you'll be fat I don't like the look of

the glasses that they gave the pandas

they are nice looking glasses to be

found

[Music]

and yeah I mostly don't wear my glasses

because I don't

it suits me but

it's not it but since yeah

too much

or do you like some other kind of work

which I am perfectly capable of working

with it and being nearsighted

because I'm working it's near the scene

so the lack of glasses isn't really

hindering me

hello

[Music]

I'm near excited I wear them even when

using a computer because I see more than

intensive music estimated I can't see

without it oh yes let's

get this screen is probably

chemistry

screen is currently 55 centimeters for

my screen

is that too close

but yeah I can perfectly I see perfectly

fine and I can even distinguish

individual pixels but that depends on

the density of the screen

which Brazilian I have with humans here

[Music]

is a 40 centimeter

you know screen with full HD

density that's not the density

[Music]

yeah there we go

[Music]

but I can see the pixels I would

consider that

[Music]

so

[Music]

I'm still working here I done

and lingling is under the edit

[Music]

is to be added now

is it sweet

[Music]

and then finally inside which I

accidentally included hats in the name

[Music]

a good eyes no I need glasses I don't

have cute eyes I already established

that

what do you mean that I can distinguish

individual pics on sunscreen

maybe I do have like good site within

the range I can see within but I have

terrible terrible size without outside

the range I can see anything

it means that hyper

and I I I'm thinking of like uh offices

but for eyes

because autism is like hyper focused

knowledge within certain areas and lack

of knowledge outside areas and

considering for everything I've said

throughout this stream you can probably

figure out that

I might have autism anyway

[Music]

I wouldn't be able to

I wouldn't be able to see a computer

be a computer and as I was pressing my

nose against the screen even like a

pizza on the screen at which points it

doesn't matter that I can't see clear

names

yeah you need a really tiny screen but

in that case everything is so tiny

[Music]

I mean it

you're not going to have many pixels on

it this is a really tiny screen with a

really high density resolution that

sounds expensive

[Music]

I mean

I'm just

and now

let me find the window because

mom

that is important and real time

[Music]

so here's how it works

oh the window doesn't show up I forgot

about that

[Music]

when I import this

brushes it can

oh it doesn't do that that's

it okay I have to go through that

afterwards then

because I can set the skeleton the back

apparently

oh wait I can do this too okay

[Music]

when in that case

[Music]

now if I have a small scale of work and

it's a fourth main screen oh

4K fancy at 2160p screen p p x p is a

shorthand for like height

because it technically stands for

I think that's here comes more random

fact from Pom-Pom the impact Skinner B

is that for Progressive unlike

interlaced interlaced renders

every other line

through the height of the screen but

Progressive renders every line

and people use p as a shorthand to refer

to the like 1080p technique it only

stands for the that's a 1080 lines in

height with a progressive scan that

every line is rendered on every frame

so but considering

interlaced is an outdated standard

that you basically don't have anymore

it's not exactly relative relative

relevant anymore

so it has become the shorthand or the

number of lines

when it technically still isn't correct

I mean what

it technically still isn't incorrect

because it's still Progressive

it's just that internet isn't really

relevant

it's used for micro projects

what's a micro print check

now it's your turn to be smart

is curious

is it like

how

okay okay okay that was it okay

it's um I would guess like how things

looks in small spines

I don't know and you need it to be

really high density pixel wise I don't

know

explain what it is and

[Music]

to make me smarter

[Music]

people

right into meter

all right I'm getting distracted by this

chord

[Music]

[Music]

so I have now imported every

[Music]

all of these

wait a minute

something's been strong

where is the Hat

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

I don't need to get rid of a Lee or

leaning because they don't have

what did they have they what did that

hats go

make your paint checks are insecurity

features and documents for example

passports and other official documents

have them like custom fonts

sorry hydrate

[Music]

for international shipping

okay

[Music]

so

attende

why didn't this work I'm pretty sure I

have the flowers selected I have the

body selected

I know wow

it set to the wrong Armature

trained at it the whole match just

didn't import it on the key

no export

design

so

switching back diarrhea

importing the mesh

[Music]

using the same skeleton and he's excited

and I don't think I need to change

anything else

search of photos for assets

in 14

and there we go

but now

it finds found another texture

and another material

because this time

[Music]

and outside of meetings

okay for some reason moving materials is

really slow I don't know why

[Music]

[Music]

and there you go

see that

and see now the panda got the flower

I mean the camera is always something so

click back to Fourth is really fast

eat some flowers

but the rest of the panda is naked

like in the original game

feet

[Music]

don't mind the naked panda so that's why

it didn't work I had set it the wrong

amateur well

in that case

I'll just have to switch the Armature

here

export it again

so that's the thing to probably check

and keep an eye on that you have

the correct Armature set

because all the parts of this mesh needs

the same Armature otherwise they will

not be the same mesh when you export it

[Music]

start let's start with those two

background premium under the back and

forth

this will be sensing

which I forgot to import last time but

that's

time

[Music]

[Music]

and waiting for the materials man

alasa

kinda forgot

it's fine

enough

here moved

next should we

[Music]

now says shui so many times and I'm

going to be used to say that

[Music]

and there we go

and another material

[Music]

s

thank you

I think I know why it's taking time

right now

no hats

now back then

is when after import it

it wants to render

and what it looks like

and then when I move it

it still wants to render it completely

and then Maps it

I appreciate that's why so if I just let

it render first and then move it it will

live almost instantly

like textures because textures don't

need rendering

any day yesterday

[Music]

the textures are of course used in the

rendering

if they don't

need rendering themselves

or I mean I guess they need rendering

but that's like in instant

but I don't remember if there's any no

this one is already using existing

material so no new

material or textures for that one

and then

get it in physics everything looks good

no new materials for that one either

I need to finally Gigi

and

it's got some material the physics

cement

import

and

there we go let's this render first

[Music]

I'm gonna see what happens

[Music]

see

them

it's not the fastest computer but it

does work which is the important part

50 40

30

. so like if I start moving now 10 left

nerve

and it's done so yeah

it has David rendering part

so save this

all the of them have their heads I can

confirm

picks up three directors

cook

and while that's happening

twitch wants another outbreak so see you

in three minutes

and for all of you who don't get an ad

we have our own private time

[Music]

and I'm kidding

foreign

[Music]

because

that's part of the subscription that you

don't get ads

you get that so you get this bonus time

meow private time

yes two and me and every other

subscriber and of course those who are

blocking ads but be done

those are those people

I'm one of those

[Music]

yeah I love it

still cooking so

but after the Earth

that means

over an hour I had three

so

[Music]

[Music]

your last is so cute

no no don't say that

you're making me blush

I'm going to

I'm going to explode

[Music]

45 minutes left

it's only 40 seconds but that's a minute

40 seconds left of the of the private

time

I'm sorry

don't be sorry

[Music]

oh my

sorry about that

[Music]

long 30 minutes

a long time a few minutes it's three

minutes and three minutes

[Music]

wait what do you mean by long three

minutes

[Music]

three minutes that means no more ads in

over an hour

[Music]

so it has a QuickTime thing

so

back to editing plus it was like a three

minutes mental break for me as well I

guess from all this morning

[Music]

about dehydrated hydrate again

so there we go are you happy

that's my thing

[Music]

[Music]

you

know

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

sorry for that

[Music]

I should

die

so anyway uh

I have located there

I basically had to show the name of

these phones that was what I think in a

good place

[Music]

if you're back I know one day hurting I

was back done I was like

I put Steve microphone on news for a

little bit but I guess I

but there wasn't anything important I

just had the palace since the panels

didn't have the correct outfit is

because

it wasn't replacing the mesh correctly

it doesn't match had the wrong name

so I hope I mustn't count for too long I

don't seems like it's been just a short

moment

it happens I've seen not extremestivity

Jesus wasn't the big failure where I

just didn't correct the microphone at

all

I mentioned that several times that was

such a silly moment

[Music]

I already placed linging but I guess I

could do that

anyway

[Music]

because this is already doing some

sorry there's nothing you can be sorry

about

sorry no I didn't have to be sorry that

means you learned that you weren't the

only person on the stream there was

another person

thank you

so it is fine

[Music]

and if this works I really should take

like a food pose

so

[Music]

much needed eating Pots if it doesn't

work

[Music]

you can't stop me

do you want ads on it because I don't

know if she's just gonna play that

so let's call it version 9.

yeah

yeah

well you didn't pay for that

[Music]

you have to pay for the animal noises

I do whatever I want

I think the person who has used the

food pass now

I can be laughing when you eat

no there is no food post now I haven't

even checked it

I haven't checked if it works for the

game yet

that was the first thing I said if this

works I'm taking food paws

if this doesn't work

hopefully it is a smart change I have to

do and then it will work and then I'll

take a food pass

why is it I don't know why the top lists

the window there's black it's not black

on my screen

name a cute mouse I wonder how

are you will you do me as on your stream

you know

being a captain on

me

fluffier trilogy

okay

it has changed

the confirmation key is about because I

went in and changed the controls

weird

meow

meow meow meow

I should have been a cat instead of a

bunny

one naked panda

do you think it's feathers

really naked pandas

sorry for the lag

four five and six naked fellas

bits

see with a fixed flower this time

because it's actually using my national

when did they say six naked pandas

I got Heat

oops

a bunny is beautiful I Define punish

cuter than cats cats I mean that's why I

am a bunny another cat obviously

I know this panda is gone

oh no

yeah this part is gone forever

well that should be the seventh naked

panda in the either way

you want either right

I either away

and a dead body

hey

I don't know

trapped frames Let's ignore that it's

not the fastest car he did Shield your

eyes get their naked what you did it

again

and another naked panda

help us Spyro

but what about the panda workings please

talk about

I'm a kitten

right I can't control this

I can't that controls

okay

that was made

okay

I'll try

apparently I can't use bring you in this

mode it broke everything

I'm not smart with birds

so make it panda

uh

apparently a naked red pepper

make it better

that panda

please help us

please hop

I think

let's do this mini game

so apparently these patterns are simply

were using the regular panda

just wait

a different texture

well in that case a well in that case

it's working pretty well

I think the mod is

basically done

yeah at this point

it only took six hours which is actually

kinda impressive

Rusty

for making a whole lot that is

trying to get around and look at these

things

like it is painless

you never really get a good look of

these banners but this is what they look

like and they apparently have a

weird texturing here

this is not my fault they have done this

it's in the original game

same thing here

and they apparent their pink ears here

so fast

yeah that's so fast

I mean I could fix that error

yes but then I need to know

in which folder is located

I don't know which folder this is

Oh no I got the teeth

they don't have teeth

can't guess I could improve these

right again it's on a 4K screen or

something

but they do have teeth it's just

misplaced

let me considering

that the pandas looks perfectly fine

and their teeth are perfectly fine

so the misplaced T is here we just

extras upside down

yeah that's just another day and done

that's not on me

because

it doesn't make any sense for the

textures to be wrong on these ones and

correct and Depends that is mechanisms

so all the texture areas you see on

these

are in the original game

and this is what it looks like

underwater

by the way

so that is basically done they are so I

should tweak the red pandas

and then I should

sure at least things

are they red pandas and fix textures on

the red pandas

right knee

teeth upside down but that's easy about

something else

and then

another change

so

I will

take something to eat

prepare something to eat when I'm it

will be rather quick and when the food

is done I will bring it

to the computer and eat it while

talking to you people

so in the meantime I don't have anything

for you

anyways uh Sunny so um

yes you can chat with each other I guess

Ethan can entertain you

or something

feels good

I should have some message here or

something then then the music disappears

well I could disable just eat scenes and

then I can can I add text add text

custom text

making food

I remember that it's 256 that's huge

air but

in

soon

I wanted to

oh and I guess this is fine

[Music]

something happened

[Music]

okay

now it says soon

but I will I will be zooming back okay

this is there

this is

making food back soon okay

well not to take too long

and

yeah

sounds good to me

I will be available on chat

oh that sounds good so I can chat with

you so just write what you want and I'll

be right back okay see you

thank you

[Music]

hello

[Music]

I hope everything goes all right

foreign

I don't know if the music is just too

loud or something

eight of us I was being good

sure hope so

I don't want any naughty cats in here

because my pasta and my

okay

and it's very hot

yeah

it is hot indeed

yep

[Music]

now we got plenty of

ad-free

time to spend chicken

since we're saying like that so

now

[Music]

let's bring up the view again

I need to find

where the texture for those pandas are

stored

[Music]

so I can access them

shouldn't I use the other software

please

I did that

is it showing up

no that's the wrong one

wait wait

is this one I want

no it doesn't show up Tony got this

video

it probably shows up when I select a

file it doesn't show the browser

okay

earthquake

yeah I need to be if I just search for

panda

[Music]

oh I just realized one thing

the place animation might not play the

sound effects doing it

hmm

that's

that's would be an issue

[Music]

okay I don't see anything here

which I of course can't show you because

it doesn't show up

and that is

anything related to that red panda

design

that's a problem

[Music]

because I got this one can this show up

this should show up

why

yeah that's the wrong one

it doesn't want to show

that's about to show the picture here

um

well that's an issue

[Music]

because these other ones doesn't contain

any

wait

oh there it is

I found it okay

I have had some success

okay let's see if I can

alright this thing

so it is located in a BC

and it's in Panda lay

I maybe showed up an original person

first GT

foreign

that's that's detection

so it's so smart

for finding I guess

and then I get to

play

which there is a texture called

oh there's additional ones here too why

I guess it makes sense

and this one looks like that

and as we can see

here's the teeth of the panda

against the t's of the other one and if

it isn't too obvious

these are not in the correct position

how did they make such a mistake

so this is obviously the dance proves

that the area was not my fault

so this textures are smaller okay

kids the game

they must have decided that that was the

location of the teeth first and then

they must have remade the pandas or

something

that's that's my guess

[Music]

and that's important is Swan

is being much determines uh light and

effects works on these things these

creatures

foreign

shortcuts

[Music]

wait a minute

why are you moving

I deleted this actually

no it's not perfect good

so I don't need the accessories

and this is the empty layer I did the

testing on

there we go

oh it's

depends on where it's okay I see

that's that

foreign

so

here are the two panels

I'm going to focus

and this is gonna go to blending

so the issues we had was first of the

teeth

but that I don't have to focus on

because that's obvious where that should

go but there was an issue Within Me

we can start having correct action

okay blender please respond

[Music]

[Music]

then they decided to not work anymore

[Music]

so that's good

I went

um

everything was giving some great so I

guess

then they wanted to mess up

it's hungry

Irish oh it stopped it's working again

[Music]

good

so this is one thing of texture field

filled on the texture

so if you go to UV

you can see that this is the part of the

neck that was

not behaving correctly and considering

is up here with the teeth that might

explain why

so what we'll do

is I will export this

as a

Lake right

UV

that's

that's the extent of my creativity

gave me a price for my

hey

creative creative names

oh it's your birthday didn't I tell you

no I didn't I thought

no

no attitude I don't think I did happy

birthday thank you lolly

I must

well I haven't I haven't been on

anyone's uh only one person though

I visited imamura when I turned it was

my birthday today but I haven't been to

anyone else and said that it's my

birthday

but I have told in the past that today

is my birthday

birthday actually

but happy to see you here

to see you here

it's inside

anyway what events did you do for your

stream

I'm currently doing it

I am making a mod

I am

modifying the pandas in Spyro 3 because

obviously it's by reignited right

it's a lot of hair

a lot of technical stuff here

um

it is

it's going it has been

[Music]

it has given me slight troubles in some

areas I'm currently I'm fixing the

texture that is wrong the texture is

technically wrong in the original game

so I'm actually going to correct the

errors they have made

very coolness thank you

so it's going to be even more correct

oh

the texture is a bit quickly

when looking at it like that

and let's hide it and so

I have the uni map here which is the leg

which I have to correct

oh yeah

so if you hide the window we can see

what's going on

this is why

it's causing these travels

this part

which I don't know what it is

so this thing is overlapping now that's

not perfect

what is this part anyway everything is

correct it's just this these parts are

offset for some reason

I don't know I don't have drinks give me

it might be the thing yeah

or

I think that deep exists at one point

okay hydrate I will I will get my drink

it will take give me a minute and I will

come

seven yeah

[Music]

[Music]

and they have big

seems like the Red Palace means yeah

yeah

that's what they

some of the pandas in one part of the

game have

they are yeah red pandas I assume they

are

and yeah it appears to be the tail

but

[Music]

but they are using the same mesh as the

default pandas in the seven and

different pants the giant pandas

and we and they don't have a large

Buffet case

no

they must have

a plan to use a different mesh but

didn't

[Music]

so I have my drink

I'm packed with my coffee perfect timing

I basically started

I found the textures and I will begin

modifying

but you just look a bit more into

hydrate

winged

I guess

this

why is the Audio Level between these

songs so different

what is that just me

this song is definitely quiet and a

penis when I think

and the next song is probably going to

be loud

yeah the

the third game was kind of rushed so I

wouldn't be surprised they planned to

make it a match but considering that the

texture is actually different

[Music]

because if I make it

half transparent

kinda hard to see I guess

but most of these parts are the same

everything lines up as far as is

possible to see

but here it clearly

needs to me I guess yeah it doesn't

align here

so they must have

but these textures aren't done

manually like this they are just

regenerated from the 3D model as far as

I know so they must have had some

different model that they generated is

from

as I think

uh going back to planet

and then I switch Yeah so this part

I could use

so yeah this pink part is inside the

mouth

so this fluffy thing

I guess just has to be gone it can't be

removed

I said it's not used

so

[Music]

here comes the editing

so I will copy over

I don't know if I should describe

everything I do here

you can write anything you want and I

will chat with you did you see my

redeemable

oh yeah sorry sorry I need to pay more

attention

the idea behind that routine

is that it's from

I think it says when you open it

oh there it is

okay I need to expand the definition of

that David and this meant

oh nice

um

let me

yeah

so the idea is that when I play a game

and there's some animals making sounds

I'm I'm going to mimic those

so I should disable it if only it was an

easy way to disable

disabled redeems

no yeah I refunded it's a at least

that's easy

but disabling it is a bit tricky

I mean I can just I actually it's not

too hard to disable it just press that

one so that should now it should be gone

but then I had to remember to enabled

I'm still expanding the redeems

sometimes I

noticed them sometimes

I miss them it's always good to

thank you

you're welcome

now let's get to let me know if if I

don't say anything a bit I guess I'm

paying more attention when I'm playing

games

oh no this is going to be annoying

this one is very pink easy to select

I need some

that

foreign

it's not important to be super accurate

but that's that's very accurate

regardless

without changes again

yeah here you go hey Steve

one outfit

I only have those two optional outfits

I would gladly like it

[Music]

I want I want it to be automatic I have

to manage it manually if it is not hard

like a Swedish phrase

have a good day

in Swedish I was thinking should it be

like

[Music]

I guess it would be like a bar and bra

dog

The Wanted short is shorten it to party

bra which means uh which means I have I

have a nice one or something I think

like that however

it also means hair good as in

haircut

it's not really grammatically correct

but

it's

so what's your anger of this mod are you

changing them to them hey I'm actually

removing the clothes

because in the original game they don't

have any clouds and for some reason at

least in the third game game they've

decided to add clothes to a lot of

characters for some reason but there's

still a lot of characters in the spider

games who don't wear any clothes and it

gets

weird

so the idea was just especially since

some of the pandas are topless in some

are bottomless and some are fully

dressed

which is also weird

which has the benefit that that could

take the top and the bottom of those and

make a fully

clothesless version

but uh

this red panda texture is strong and

it's just wrong in the original game

it's not I don't

haven't done anything about that

so this must be the inside of the mouth

yeah

which I now have here

these are the feet which is this part

but that's a bit annoying because

they're a bit off so I need to fix that

yeah because it should be all or nothing

otherwise it makes sometimes naked yeah

exactly

naked

so the goal is to make them resemble the

trilogy it's more like

I let them appear just as they do in

reignite it it's just the

lack of clothes it's the only thing I'm

going for here

good way to describe it

while I'm using the models directly from

the game so it's not

ask them I don't know

it's it will be accurate as accurate as

I can make it

[Music]

if I just select basically but I love to

use the board basically for some reason

and then I

just follow

peace

yeah I should like this

sorry I couldn't stay long but I wanted

a nice wish I happy birthdays it's fine

I'm glad for help regardless how long

you stay it makes me happy

it's really nice to see here

um

but there

are a really bad MPC train tracking

people

have a nice day

see you later yeah I like to

I would probably show up on one of your

stream at some point

thank you

I'm really awkward with

talking to people

the streaming is really

but I'm

doing my best

being all awkward

when people here like me are being

awkward can stay

[Music]

then um

[Music]

it's

it's being like this

this is even showing the selection on

the screen

I don't know because I kind of I don't

have two screens I can see

I'm happy

regardless how

about people because yeah

now I'm basically talking to myself but

you got whatever

some people just show up for like a few

minutes saying hello and that's

perfectly fine it's it's nice regardless

I mean they might still be watching they

just don't write anything more

so so as far as communication wise

they're gone

[Music]

not cute I love you boys

I am thankful for that

I feel like my voice is weird sometimes

I feel like that my whole life really

that

that my voice changes a lot depending on

emotions and things like that

and now I see

getting older changes my voice too

they're pretty cute

now you're super cute

[Music]

following assets does these lines I'm

selecting currently show up because I'm

[Music]

I assume

obviously nothing shows up because I

have the name of the function

because I'm stupid

it is showing up

it

[Music]

but I didn't switch everything

as you can see in work never sleep

without me

the secret program

um you're making me blush you're making

me blush yourself big

yeah

okay that's my revenge I'm making you

blush

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

blue has the best contrast

that means I will turn and use

a channel mixing

but I will make

everything be the blue Channel

which sounds great of course but

that means that

I'm going to eat some more

because I'm hungry

oh you sounds like that makes my sense

your sounds are so cute I mean I guess

that makes sense too

it is

20 to 20. that's a good time right

[Music]

1939 but

almost 1940s so it's 20 to 20.

okay so I need to

for these white spots here

which has 81 in brightness and it loaded

8. 84

181 but seven

should it be lowered by let's see

I will make new notes

181 should be 84.

and I have a check like this area

where's the kids like

and like

154

yeah it should be the other one

yeah so it's not levered evenly

it's fine

[Music]

there's so much more formula you can use

to figure this out I mean it really

should make a document that doesn't for

me

[Music]

okay

[Music]

that's actually

oh look at this now it's getting close

so it should H4 so it should be like a

little criteria that's 84 that's 84.

[Music]

this is empty one but it should be seven

oh it's second

we made this really strong today

well I guess you could put some water in

it

[Music]

I don't know how Coffee Works

foreign

[Music]

so

did I you're doing to the layers you

just kind of hidden behind one

he was still wearing her swimsuits but

it's only been 40 minutes so far

it's 14.

[Music]

I guess I would do the time a shorter

there are more

more outfits to pick from and more

people who are interacting with the

outfit changing

and then I just do some my peanut

this

foreign

[Music]

models that you barely see in the game

and yeah I should probably not put too

much effort in this

I'm still going to put some effort into

it like showing the skills I have

[Music]

and the different mod techniques I use

like this

now it's almost like it never existed

this scene

I hope the music isn't

too repetitive

it's only no no no obviously I play

music from James but

this had to do for this time

I like strong coffee

strong

coffee that's able to lift Stone

so

now

these should turn into 77 26 and 10.

and what's the default value 84.

so apply another one of these

[Music]

this time I need to change him

see here I could probably use some

mathematical formula here let's do that

because this one is

basically

so if it should be seven seven and you

hit 84 that means that it's 91

92 percent

you multiply that by 255 and the answer

is 234.

and if I insert turn it into four I get

77 and the multiple and the formula is

working

we take 0.6 divided weight four multiply

between a 45 and it's 7 7 9.

this month is 79

and I get 0.6

it's working 10 divided by 8 4.

multiplying by 255 is society so I said

another one deciding

and it is and

and now this part

should appear like this part

some need some

and it looks a bit more dull

because this part is darker because just

is

okay let's see

it's 7 14 and 5.

yeah and this part is 57 19 and seven

not very close though but there's a

means but that's specific part

most of this is not as dark

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

but gonna be awake for a while because I

have a whole lot of coffee here oh

that sounds nice

two

with the eights this is too dark

[Music]

right now I'm at the work and drink all

the coffee all of it didn't you share

it took out for yourself

[Music]

okay 21 I should try to know it what

team

and eight I should lower to five

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

changes

no problem I just restart

I just have new values

78

65 61.

I just do the same calculation again

consuming the right time eight times 25.

it's 252 it's a very very slight

Darkness

minutes

when it is 6 divided by 65 times

25 is 102.

and finally

then by the 61 times 25 is 42

and there we go

it's not as perfect it's still a bit

dull but it's better

that's how you say I love caffeine

polish

well now I'm the second in right here in

my supervised student alike

and the lower ranks are so ads oh

well in that case

all coffee for you

I only put a small amount of sugar in my

coffee

okay

as I drink my soda here

and some hydrating

I put chicken in my coffee

fancy people okay

drinking things with children

and sugar sugar

oh that sounds like something

okay now let's see

I corrected thanks

as well as a kid

still like strong

[Music]

but at some time is the toilet

and

that part shouldn't matter

but

if you know me I am picky

and if you don't know me hello I am

picky

foreign

[Music]

the only thing left to do is the ear

but the problem is

where on this thing is are the ears

my rank is llt left trigger right

and my super is the St rank okay so they

they have the depth trigger you have the

right trigger and then you have the

center tricky which is well with an S

okay I get it

much so

Cafe

um

I know how picky

am I

I don't like deep rabbits now

lt's Lieutenant now it's left tricky

it's the ears went here

somewhere here

[Music]

okay let's

go back to blending

ultimately means something like see see

I knew it was left tricky

okay I was wanting my Steamers exactly

yeah

SLS stand for supervisor

and T stands for traffic

and L stands for

complete

Antonio so pick it's so cute

and I have a poor

sense of chips

my chips are terrible

but I guess that's what makes them fun

it's important to understand our jokes

of course

so this is the ear

both ears layers on top of each other

wait how does that work we can't you

can't do an UV map if you land each

other

oh well

no I would like sport things

and this time I will call it

near UV

[Music]

ddsl stand for lead yes Elite traffic

controller and as this is the supervisor

traffic controller

it's just that the controller part is

not part of their abbreviation acronym

that's what I said

it is if I were to make a guess that

would be my best guess because I had no

idea

you got the other rights yes now Alice

left

okay yes when I eat something I got one

out of four and that's 25 percent

and that's right okay I got two after

four that's 40 that's 50 I got them I

got a percent wrong

see I'm not that stupid I still don't

know what T stands for so

it's lead and supervisor and then it's

basically yes sir

no you are

but but yeah

foreign

so team

supervising team

two people

can get something in my

throat

in this case here

Facebook

this is the wrong language okay now I'm

back in English

[Music]

so I will take this

India now basically do the exact same

thing but it's it's kind fading here

I don't like that

so let's see if I can do this trick

because this is very single colored

what's this

I think you were here at the start

why didn't you see when I started

loading the models

into blender

and also

it's been 31 minutes for The Outfits

back to dress

[Music]

hey it's astronaut Mouse again it's the

it's the most astral of Alma my mouses

there are mice

this is your voice okay so it is Blended

yes it's the previous program was not

Blended but this is Monday and yeah and

as you can see I don't know how far I

got when before you left or lurked

it was you're free to do whatever you

want so now the panda is naked

and the panda has a white butt maybe you

didn't know that when you're playing the

game but now you know

a mouse I'm on the hunt no hunting other

users in the chat you have to take that

somewhere else

I'm thinking Mouse

what

what what but what do you say what

the T is for officials don't ask me how

is it in a different language

in Swedish for Mouse not to be confused

with moose

which is L although it's not called

Moose it's called elk which is related

to Ellie

there we go

foreign

let me do a very quick search for

languages for official

preparing that's what I said to an

office or public trust approved by

Authority

derived from the proper office and

whatever whichever works

for the end languages that puts

it is Tagalog for for two kulani

but that's all that can't beat

foreign

well that's that's uh that's official in

in Tagalog

ah

what

otherwise

otherwise I don't see any other language

that starts with a T unless if you want

to consider Vietnamese

where it is called

young thick

but that's two words

yeah in Swedish yeah if you like if you

want to hear more Swedish there is the

redeem that you type an English phrase

and I will say it in switch

it of course has to be in English

because I don't understand another

language unless you of course write it

in Norwegian maybe Danish if it's simple

enough German

yeah

foreign

but not like Spanish or polish and

unless it's like

a

pita

in that case

I don't know where they got the tea from

when I started is from Tagalog obviously

maybe she doesn't I went to Denmark once

and saw the bridge that goes to Sweden

you only looked at it she never went

over it it never went to Freedom

packages

you you voluntarily went to Denmark

it will do such a thing

it's about my pigment

to know what it is

maybe maybe someday

maybe some I like them at night

wait wait I like Denmark I actually

don't have anything personal against

Denmark I actually would like to visit

Denmark

so

it seems like a nice place but back here

this part I'm working on currently is

the ear because here's the thing which

you didn't see because you weren't here

this is the official texture for the

panda it looks a bit creepy but that's

what sex is oh wait that's that's just I

take this eye

this is the official texture for the red

panda

she's also in the game

if I switch between these too

you might notice that at the top

of the texture the things changes like

the lower

research doesn't change or like three

quarters but whatever but it's just a

tough one that changes

you must noticeable the teeth

but also how the plant has an ear top

left that is an ear

but

the red panda

true Panda

and it has the mouth

so they have a completed

so if this is intended for a different

mesh

but they are using the same mesh in the

game so so it looked wrong

foreign

I like Sweden that's good I mean have

you been to Sweden I don't remember if

you

were the one who bent this Sweden yet I

don't remember

I've never been to Europe

while you have the company Europe

I've been deciding different states in

the US though

also been to Mexico a couple of times

not many different states

and the other

primary divisions of countries have I

been to quite a few

we have a city nearby that was founded

by the people of Sweden in 1888. it's a

nice little city city

yeah

that would be interesting to look at

actually but

I wouldn't be able to afford such trip

what a nice love song this is

it's like they're playing the song in

slow motion

isn't this uh it says the bottom left

corner

I'm currently

did I switch me

I was forgetting that

I did switch me

yeah it's a shark

yeah I was going to guess that it was

dark

[Music]

okay let's keep spy music let's go back

to this game

okay wait

quite let me correct that

okay now let's go

still be quiet

the food is Swedish flag for a while

maybe they should have a switch flag

this is black

adjusted music to this song because this

is much more quiet this is like Bachelor

music

explosion kaboom

yeah this is from a game I should play

on stream someday

it has quite

interesting set of songs

[Music]

kind of reminds me of

Joe satarani I think I don't know how to

know how to get me from from 1998

and get me if I explode

get into pieces

is that a good day

[Music]

it looked funny when you're ready like

that

but that's a good day

okay back to what oh

okay

right back to what I was doing

so this one is 37 984 as as colors

but then I was going to figure out what

part of this texture is actually the

proper ears

this part kind of looks like this part

14

57 35.

[Music]

you find all the pieces and put it back

together

[Music]

while this pink colors remain the same

so I'm taking note of that

[Music]

is starting should be the same

a lot of

planning out colors here that's part of

modding

I'm very picky with 190 mods but my mods

do turn out to be quite high quality in

your hand so I think it's worth it

I strive for a high quality model with

very little

about

it

so now

[Music]

wait I should send this one

did

some of you might not have seen it

very much that's so cute

yes my mods are very cute black kitten

freak for life is a cute knot

and Julie that's his also cute mat

you weren't talking about those mods

oh you meant you meant these ones I'm

making ah

now these are not cute

and I don't know what you're talking

about

okay we got this

I doesn't share the window okay um

that one I'm going to input some number

into this window doesn't lose our

history

fun fun month is best month

and Batman is a good one

I put a lot of care into that one

[Music]

okay this turned out

pretty Springs

[Music]

dinner

[Music]

fun fun one is best month

you don't say that maybe I did

[Music]

let's watch cheating

I'm half I'm I'm actually seeing two

streamers and I didn't watch it live

only

cut it after they didn't stream

when they did use my mod

and they did like it I mean obviously

they did like enough to actually

commit to actually using it

so that was pretty nice to see

okay

this is bad actually

[Music]

that is cute yeah yeah I wanted to chat

continue being cute

it's an order

[Music]

hey you have no choice but being cute

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

it was

saying something

of course of course you were you would

wear sports

wear during

nothing

it says that

this is a super sweaty

sink

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

yeah how am I supposed to do this

I think I just have to

because what's ruining my

attempt of modifying this is still

gradient

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

I think that was enough Mouse

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

it should be this color

hello

so this is

[Music]

too bright

percentage

[Music]

that's

[Music]

26 seconds technique right here

so

denying more right

[Music]

with 90 bright that's that's around what

50 60. lightly too dark

is that perfect

and then leave it too dark

turkey

sorry tonight

six different

artists between those two

satisfied perfect

to change this part of image

honestly kidding Inspire like you being

here

that's why you have to stay here

and never

disappear

I mean I

our

I will never want to hear you insult

here

these are pain

that would

rude

[Music]

okay I will create a mask from this

so 30

not like exactly

oh my I would stay here for with you

forever

that would be

that would be really nice

it can be

friends forever

and I don't have to be alone anymore

fine

hold on baby

[Music]

it's just a slightly again I think I

could be wrong but I think it's just a

slime ingredient

s

we have friends I hear when you need me

we are here

almost all the time when I stream which

is really bad

I'm going to need to have things we take

care of

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

so

that option is expand

yeah because I could do this

[Music]

now the music's a bit heavier

foreign

[Music]

that should be good now

I can apply

mask like this and then here

Okay so

do you I think

[Music]

they actually

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

I'm glad to have a friend that's cool as

he performed

I'm glad that you

and I'm glad to have you here as a

friend and that he was super willing to

show up for my stream

yeah

and

the risk yourself

[Music]

and put yourself to hearing my

[Music]

wait what does it looks like a red panda

the red pen actually look like they

actually have white yes

so

[Music]

they have a black backside so

technically

technically

so if I go back to plan day

so technically

I've said that word nine times

so this will be like a seam here but it

goes from White

Brown

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

and it kind of shows the clutch yeah for

shy

and if I ignore that part

not right there

so if I know that part and only focuses

on this that goes through in here if

you're so awesome thank you

[Music]

you are awesome

being so possible

[Music]

[Music]

all right with this

[Music]

so

I should probably have

cute

but to be fair I use a lot of cats for

being a bunnies well who am I to speak

[Music]

[Music]

it's a bunny

it's just bad

quite a detailed picture

it's supposed to be away but I can't a

lot of them have traveled seeing the way

in this Countryside

if there was something

it's nice

[Music]

just

a bit hard to figure out as well as game

but it didn't match

and she's back in here

[Music]

this much nonsense

now

[Music]

[Music]

I'm sinking

thank you

[Music]

it's I don't know I had pets but one

point there's no such thing

[Music]

it is

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

work at the moment

[Music]

this is the kind of alert

[Music]

and alert screen

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

okay

am I Indian

s

is working each

me not feeling

them

thanks

this is terrible terrible terrible

reference is

Maybe

not just

do this

Cuts your statements

but

and

[Music]

the funnel

yes

[Music]

so

now with this new texture

which I now can save I should have saved

it before anyway

[Music]

characters

name this is

[Music]

a little document because that sounds

good to do

but then I save it as

[Music]

same like this

take it back I

[Music]

ch

what

I didn't want you to save it but I

pressed I need it I didn't think

[Music]

oh

sorry sorry

I'm missing I'm missing the redeems

right right

[Music]

thank you

a Swedish phrase for

[Music]

what should I like to write Swedish

translation

little bunny named

[Music]

how would they even Translate silly

because silly is like

[Music]

silly is like a

I'm using through foolishness

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

Swedish

yeah I like if I if I like look up

Swedish word for silly I get trumstick

which

which

yeah it keeps like the English

definition of

[Music]

like theft

I isn't that quite a negative

another word is foreign

[Music]

[Music]

it

you look at me funny a funny bunny yeah

yeah that's that's what I've got like

silly silly small like

being a stupid in a funny way like

intentionally you're not

you're not actually stupid just uh doing

it for the fun of

but I don't feel like there is actually

a good English in Swedish time for that

practice bye and so

I guess the closest you will get is

York island daily living canine

some heated pom pom

there you go I hope you're happy

that's

yeah it's the best I can do

and it's pretty good I think

foreign

Lake actually works the best but it

still to me has this more of a negative

like

someone could call you out for being

lately like you should

behave a bit more but sure

it's not like

it's not actually calling you stupid or

anything it's just like you're acting a

bit stupid I know you can act better

it's more like that

laughs

very cute I'm really happy maybe sweets

are more like to be honest

or something I don't know

right then nowadays like these culture

differences

and there are often directs and words

that have like all the same

but she's stupid

[Music]

oh yeah did I say that all right yeah

that's what I was doing I was I was

I was the same in this stuff

oh yeah

so that's the that's that and then I

save it

as a copy

to be loaded into unreal

which I know

blender

there we go

the issue with the leg is fixed

uh the tail is wrong but

uh

wrong but I think the ears are much

better now

than the pink mouth in your staff before

but yeah I do still want something

around the edges

it's just something

[Music]

so maybe I could like copy this to be

used as

a guide

yeah yeah I should probably do that okay

let's do it

I'll take this

foreign

they don't get much they don't actually

appear as actual characters in level the

NPCs you can interact with

these

the only thing you can interact with

them is kill them

you can't kill them that's the only

introduction

yeah that's that's what they did in the

game so

now

I'm going to bend this thing with a tool

that is this one

um

and then I choose this Mount but

the other way

sorry sorry sorry I can't hear sorry

sorry look

I'm working I'm working

something important

I'm not used to switching between views

but this this streaming service doesn't

really match it easy

to project the whole stop but I don't

want to

hydrate

I really need some kind of notification

sound

something like that I think would be

good this is the old pass

then

I mean I didn't make any path

zero

this move is further in

[Music]

[Music]

today

anything else funny going on

[Music]

a silly pan is spending way too much

time on our character that's probably

something which I mentioned probably

five times now

but this this is basically The Last

Detail and then I'm happy

[Music]

and

now it's hot outside

hot like I mean

hot weather

that's what I meant

I got the hang of the pen too

nice and did you

watch this tutorial

this this display of how to use the

attention

because this is basically how I use it

but that's this

it suits

as soon as you get the hang of it it's a

pretty Institute to use

I might pump on I heard that wait what

did you hide here

I don't hear anything

I heard something

foreign

so

[Music]

now with this instead

now if I say it over this time

start I'm going to go back to planning

so I said define and then I reload the

file here let's go into here reload so

it's wavy like that

and

oh

I forgot about that but I got this part

it's not that part

you know what I'm talking about hot

weather oh

[Music]

yeah that's obvious

I knew that

of course

[Music]

oh yeah

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

yeah I basically have to use to follow

this edge around

and then

thank you

you said something about fun fun

I didn't

I heard that should I be sneaking around

me do you have a lot of

history play maybe you should do that

refresh see

I mean it seems like

this is quite a delay from when you

there's something when I say something

yeah

typing on the phone so it's fine I

didn't consider it's time it takes time

[Music]

I mean I cannot obviously don't work on

a picky be extreme right but having some

kind of notification that you're typing

would be useful

[Music]

and it could do some kind of

context based to know which users are

relevant for example if someone just

rented the Raider is relevant to show if

they're typing

and if I usually just wrote the message

I guess if they start typing a new

message I guess that's relevant

but that's

that is not going to work

they sound like I'm going to work a

small challenge but maybe

or like when it's slow do you people I

think

I'm always full of ideas

but anyways searching a good job thank

you

I am kind of satisfied with

what I have managed to do so far

[Music]

so

let's come on

[Music]

it looks kind of fluffy

updated

totally forgot to change view again

typical me

it wasn't too exciting to watch anime I

guess I don't know there you go

it is in Japan with decoration

thank you my name is

Ginger Brothers

well I think that's pretty good

wouldn't you say

foreign

what I do is

add a line

no no I don't

like

that's a Quick tune

I activate

it

that's autoclave again the wrong one

make activate Inner Glow now it doesn't

show up

there it is

yep yep

they only need a small amount

all right it's only showing the results

doesn't show the actual settings I'm

changing but I guess it's fine

I guess it's fine

it doesn't mean that I expected too much

oops

okay maybe it's not something more like

that okay that's good

though the only

troubled part left is the tail which is

something you would see in the game as

you basically see them behind me so

I blend it and they stay and then I go

to TV editor and the tank is here okay

so

come back to photoshop it's not really

important

wait wait

yeah I need that part

actually let me export that

it can actually be quite useful

so I export this as a tail

UV

like radio station

[Music]

so and then now pack the Photoshop

this means that I can import

right dinner the same today but still

saving it's kind of slow

what's happening

it's done perfect now

I import the tail UV

[Music]

and now time for some more random facts

with fun fun

why is it called UV

[Music]

do you use

[Music]

how it

issues then

it starts

[Music]

UV ultraviolet nope

it's called UV because in 3D modeling

you have X so in 2D model a 2d you have

X and Y in 3D you have x y and z

so

but when it comes to rotation while you

can have x y z rotation sometimes a

different kind of rotation which I

actually don't know exactly our details

about you can also have a w x y set

rotation they needed a fourth letter so

instead of continuing because it's the

end of the alphabet they want the other

direction and went with w

and UV is

extending it even further

so UV is not an actually any tuning for

anything it is just the two letters

before don't you

because

this means that you have w x y z or

the position rotation and then you have

UV as the represent representation of X

and Y on the 2D texture

I'm not that smart but you're so smart

it's just randomly the easiest random

facts

random facts with fun fun

[Music]

I'm a smart idea

because I'm doing many weird stuff at

the moments

he's a kid

now you're so cute

should have a cuteness band

see how the cutest is

people keep writing me on Discord I do

not have time Kitty might not actually

writing to me I'm actually in a few

groups it keeps yesterday summer

breaking someone else to be fair

to be fair

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

okay now

it doesn't need to cut this stuff up

so I don't need this anymore

eat stuff

[Music]

and also you got a lot of bonus time on

that don't you

at this point

I don't speak Spanish if you haven't

noticed

I am so sorry

I cannot help you

time

imagine it's making more expensive

because now we are kind of messing up

your coins

[Music]

this must be a 10 right

thank you I'm sorry sorry for what

I don't understand the thing you're

saying that you use it's basic stuff

okay

no it's it's really

it was more like a funny fact that UV

which is the

picture on that 50 model

it's not an action for anything it's

just the two letters that comes before W

that's

and it's not like that's the only reason

is that's it it's behind it we just

a funny fact

that it doesn't stand for anything

it's fun fun stuff it's punished

funny stuff

Pony stuff

lucky

so far

[Music]

I have a lot of funny stuff

not a lot I like what kind of fun is

that yeah

I have bunny plushies

it's fun stuff

okay since I'm actually going to take

one part of the texture

somewhere else

make sure funny jokes about that

I should copy them over here when I read

it

and as seen here

is

but it doesn't seem to oh yeah it

doesn't like it

[Music]

but I do need to make sure it works good

okay

this is a spot

so

this part

so I'm going to move it

1500 down that means that this is going

to be halfway 750.

and then it's going to move

6 out of 56 and that's 650

so 325

328.

yeah 20. yep

[Music]

and then I will move this bit extra

because it's not really centered

one two

three

this means that this is removed one two

three four five six

and then I'll shank it down here

after size now I come to the topic size

[Music]

and it's awesome it's analysis

right

that's why it doesn't scale me should

you like

60 15.

I think that could work

it's right there too

see which team

then I move it

one

and one down that looks good yes

that means one two one two

[Music]

[Music]

okay now now I can save this and

so many

nice thank you

we'll see how it looks on the model and

see if it actually looks nice

oh wait I forgot

what I forgot about that but this stuff

at the top should be included too

okay thank you

we came back Monday

and then we reload this and this tail

here should change this that's really

love command and I forgot that this

thing must enabled

um

it's able save again

so I can exhaust it to the play the

music that I've been playing the same I

think that's is that two

now that's three laps of the music

though I didn't know

I know I know it doesn't

it doesn't work properly

it's it's me side lined

it's me sun line

so I need to rotate it

do you think so

you think I can fix it

if I rotated three degrees

I know so oh

hello

best word in Swedish is

it's fun to say

okay I mean it's not a fun creature

you know dancing so far what to say

[Music]

to be honest

Olek it is basically aligned

it's not perfectly around

it looks like it should be perfectly

annoying but it isn't

actually be like

it's nicely rotated back a little

like that

need that rotate it slightly too much

okay

let me switch this one too

UV editor instead

yeah no it's too much instead

so it should be like to

comma 27.

that's no problem

and maybe you could do it I've not done

it just yet

I just need to

do one more

I mean it's

it's pretty good it's not perfect but

it's pretty good

really cute

foreign

that would be sad

so if I scale this down

okay I need you could do it it's nice

and I just realized I

I really forgot

it's not proper Highway around to fix

that

that's it

our way to do that

set there we go

sound

and I will copy this over to the other

one

I guess I want to copy this

and basically replace that point

so this is all this is the knee okay

let me save this as one

no

so this run say command this is the

RM

it's gonna

buy it without music let's let's start

that first game again

because it has such bad music day I've

heard it by music so much

I wish they had small songs in this game

but oh well it is what it is

[Music]

and then there's

dishes

all right this is the earth president

and it's so nice just to hear you guys

it's so cute

I don't like this

music

[Music]

This is actually

[Music]

the music's fine

[Music]

the music is fine but that's just one

key on your phone

your device and messing in

okay I use

duplicate duplicate

duplicate

and then I got to go

sorry

I have been streaming for nine and a

half hours so

so close

[Music]

it's interesting that it's a bit

different shade

that's difficulty being so silly

questions

[Music]

about everything I was planning on doing

but it became part of the seniors work

here

[Music]

okay all right

not about that today okay

R is an a-r-m-e for some reason and

because e stands for

yeah

a mission but the emission map is

completely black

so I'm not really sure what seats it's

an r a r m e is a just an arm

would be without the mission mask

yes there is no emission on this red

panda

just wasting

splits I guess that's just the quality

of the game hydrate

okay

[Music]

switching over to unreal

I got it again today

here is

[Music]

more red panda

they've been

they haven't been treated well

I need it and c u r n e

inserted into unwind engine I will

editor

[Music]

thank you

oh and then I should be able to asset

actions what can be property Matrix

check the normal map

and character and

another

that should be it

save

and cook

[Music]

the music is kind of nice if you like

this

[Music]

if you don't like me

I mean

I try to collect like and different kind

of music but

it's hard to find

we got what I could get

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

there's one thing where I would want to

do is that because I'm basically

importing all the animations replacing

skeleton and replacing the mesh and

doing texture placement

at this this point I should probably

just include other all the behind this I

don't replace these two original files

as a complete set

we jumped Manny and that would be the

original picture

so let me just scan those

which I do

here

it's Chichi which has the extrins

so I

export raw yes please

[Music]

anyway

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

what's up

[Music]

now that means that I have now added

additional textures to the project

now I should add image done

[Music]

and my tears

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

now I don't want to touch the print

oh

what's more do you have the other one

only contains messages so that's nothing

to touch

touch

but they should have the

materials for the retainers

yep

export

add it to the project

all right

and finally

should be

next time singsing

chest knee

and the stack

which I should take the original

slime

[Music]

and then I should take the

the cookies

[Music]

pictures for the red panda

[Music]

like that

and I think that's all I think this is

the

version

1.0 full version ready to be released

after nine hours 20 minutes

[Music]

you did it well I haven't tested it yet

not so fast

[Music]

we can't claim that it is done okay

wait a minute

[Music]

okay

look at this final increase

after adding all this extra

[Music]

more than triple its size

but it should hopefully ensure that the

mod is more stable and runs

without issue if you try to combine it

other mods because this mod will be more

[Music]

yeah

itself content

[Music]

eat after him

[Music]

it is

[Music]

correct

[Music]

[Music]

it's a kid from this lash but

no no because with kids

that should be a crime

that if I make it

[Music]

and then

laughing at it

oh yeah I was going to reset the default

name

and now it's back to

not

but

I was going to say tomorrow but tomorrow

is a Sunday

the day after tomorrow it will will be

more racing which are stories I know

kitten and Oregonian were

enjoyed except that

it will be the new game so

just speaking about future so this panda

looks perfectly normal as usual let me

just confirm everything looks normal

these pandas are

functioning

okay is playing idle animation when

speaking I have no idea if that has

anything to do with my mod does it make

any sense because that would have things

to do with like the blueprints

Blueprints and everything

and the panel stack is working perfectly

normal so good

I still don't get why they're standing

like that

yeah considering

yes they need to get started reach

up

but after that they could just have

no longer standing in a stack

but now

this panel looks perfectly normal

it is these Palace I'm curious about

that but it's perfectly fine

it states the red pandas oh no

what are you doing

now what are you doing

why are why

why are you

why why are you specifically in you

is this

is this

wait what's going on

it must be lay okay it must be late it's

based on

no this one is a flower so it's not late

I'll sing it like this one

the hat is the only thing I can go on

this one

I'm sharing what I'm doing yes so that

one and that one has the head which same

hats lay has and lei is the one that has

the

uh this texture

when the tail is working

the ears are working nicely

because the inside should be pink but

black instead it's not how it changed

but

and also the teeth are working

cute everything is after I fix it except

for the Furious deposing but

is that because I haven't entered the

area

it could be that it could have nothing

to do with

it it's nice

wait what

bamboo

is it because I already completed it

oh no oh no wait uh yeah so now they're

working okay the Furious t-post thing

was only because if we enter the area it

doesn't loaded the animation properly

but if you work forward and talk to the

panda it does the property

good

then I I have hello

what are you so happy about

your

to have someone who stole your house and

it's ready to marry you for it

saying stole your house when you are

gonna house this artist they're like

built into the wall

but there are four buildings inside the

walls but

where are your toy how are you supposed

to get into this building

there is no door anywhere

100 panda

hello

is a great I should take a screenshot of

this

that's not not 8K that will that would

explode the computing

foreign

of this situation

look at this power up

looking good thank you uh it's looking

this

looks even better

arguably ears might could have been

slightly better

this looks better better

better better

than the original game

the original game has a glitchy tail

has a weird thing on the leg

stripe I don't know where this is from

any Pixley

has

uh what's more about it yeah the ears

were inside the insides of the mouth

the inside of the mouse was the texture

of the tail the teeth was all offset and

that was that's in the original game

but now I made it

nice and beautiful

and naked but let's ignore that he did

so cute

yeah so much nicer

so I guess I should

n't

reloads everything as soon as you take a

screenshot for some reason

someone start

um

anyway let's leave this area

all right all right the camera is still

in this area no problem

wait

oh yeah right so many

this area is behind

it's almost like you could see it from

there

but yeah it's that structure anyway

um

there was such a threat yeah

anyway

I don't know I'm not great at taking

photos screenshots but

I think delete this one there okay can

you take the screenshot I see from the

screenshot now I guess

it contracts a bit bad

what is it

nice to take a screenshot

now it's taking a screenshot

and then after this screenshot it goes

down the lowest

qualities

and this Panda loves bamboo

like I like I like this hat I just don't

like the

the one where you

beef

well

wrap the hair around the

I would assume it's a piece of bamboo a

round bamboo and then you put that on

your head and

perfectly fine with like the hairstyle

I have no issue with that but I have an

issue with

none of this Panda size there's only one

Panda that has that actually not the

hairstyle

which would be this Panda here which is

noted for some reason

yeah

this panda

like is this black hair

but where does the black hair come from

where there's no other Panda black I

assume that's that's what this is

supposed to be

I mean what else is it

it's not the correct color of the hair

and everything

yeah I think they could have done that

very

basically what I'm saying

there are no pandas in there

let's get an overview

no matter now

uh here's thing

yeah

but this one doesn't contain any panels

as far as I know

but it does contain chips because I

haven't been in here

in a basket

as follow me is up here because

I guess not until you fell into this

area

or no others so empty

so

so empty so

still

it's almost like the game is Frozen

all right is it like an extra knife here

maybe he doesn't love the diner

and then yeah there should be an egg

here

where there's some things a little bit

not the whole thing

no no they're not parents in this area

anyway can you see the halves of this

yeah we can

[Music]

that means that often when I have these

kind of models they have one model for

and it's called Uh not broken look maybe

these are already broken and then when

they break into parts that's then they

swap out for a different model as far as

I can tell

and it's the same model

as it cuts these sides inside it

because if you don't know if you try to

look from the inside out of an object

you cannot see

that you cannot see from other side but

because we can see these things

that means that

uh

yeah

if you never know it's hard to explain

it's almost like you would be able to

see yeah you should be able to see that

start from here

and that structure is the one you get to

by entering portal really

spider

what inspiring

oh

let me

I had someone

you know what it works

and why can't I oh there you are

and why can't I

change

okay

wait

however because that I know that's a bug

that can happen basically you get stuck

in camera control and cannot control the

character but this means that if we go

into the level again

and this is fact this is actually

something quite interesting I think if I

remember correctly

sometimes you just glitch a bit more and

there we go there we go

I hope I did it correctly though

because now

I said I don't know if the rdf game

works again because I God

the picture is obviously working I used

to be stay here because you can capture

a window and show it as a picture but it

doesn't capture the audio so I have to

capture the audio separately

fix that

actually here that's good there we go

foreign

because one wasn't enough and it is

fully like

it does every it does idle animations

and everything so it's like a fully full

a full player character

but I can only control one of them but

it is it's still a full playable

character as a full player control

player character since they are gonna

mention everything

and of course you cannot attack yourself

because both are players

but

this is also interesting

okay it's much more obviously

customer additional damage

there you go

and also this the second player which I

guess is in this case has its own

separate Health meter it's not that it's

not a global Health it's individually

per play

and I find that interesting because

there's obviously no plans to do a

multiplayer mode in this game

but for some reason

a nice nice bike today

for some reason you have separate yeah

should I make damage myself to show that

yeah there you go that would be a

different house

so

yeah I have this happen sometimes it's

in Lucky Amazon yeah but but it's the

whole the whole thing is that this is a

full playable character with his own

health meat and everything but that's

part of fun very interesting

and also then you do this

you can't say this you lose a life

did you have a global lives and like a

global

game over State and all that stuff

but not health and I find that weird

yeah yeah poor point one there is a dead

pump on here

it's a very weird on this

it looks fine normally but

I try to really try to fix the legs

but yeah the legs are really weird one

bent like that

I haven't spoken to you like twice now

stop speaking to me

yeah I had a constantly driving spirals

oh no

one poor spider drowning

I think you need them or something

yeah there's a dead pump on there

she doesn't take any damage but but yeah

so that's

that's that

is the mod basically done now

what should they not be called okay give

me some ideas I don't know

you don't have to feed on Friday

currently I find this country at Japan

this but I don't think that's a good

name

anyway I should close down some software

I guess it's done it's not nothing I

forgetting

little pan pan what

what do you mean like pan pandas

nah that's a that's a stupid name

sorry

I mean

Excavating

I mean I was

consider changing the air inside the

black now I

write music sorry

why is it still showing

um close this let's start

we got like a quarter extra on that

outfit change it's okay I don't know at

the kite

yeah I don't know

I don't know

it is fine

but I will prepare uploading this stuff

to

yeah next to smart and Inspire that

expire next is smart and then the mod

database

and

I guess

that's exciting stuff to look at I don't

know

why

yeah I press this condition

or description yes

so

I should

I was supposed to have a name on them uh

currently I called it retro pandas but I

don't think that's a good name because

that kind of implies something else

and

I don't want to tell that Colin nude

pandas

that's I don't think that would be a

good name

so

um

we're gonna say and the microphone isn't

working this working but just not

showing I think it's wearing there

with my speaking without anyone playing

me again like I did before let's see a

cute bunny

I mean

yeah

he's been there all the time

it's burning into your screen and

this is a good idea for having her

animated

asset name

um

who am I

that's less pandas

isn't very this best thing I have now I

just want a name that doesn't like

implies anything naughty which removing

clothes can implies but it is nothing

like that it's just reflecting back

to how they were in the PlayStation one

this one is a kit you might recognize

this bunny you might have seen this

bunny before

or something I don't know

clothless pandas so far

of panda the old Panda what

[Music]

this is the hardest part showing up with

a name

oh the pattern that just seems to be

some something different

[Music]

I don't know what to say

I don't know either

I am confused

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

panels are natural

I think this is

[Music]

I'm going to take my

so I should probably take my fracturing

headphones as

flammable scratching and functions uh

well none of them what I mean as a basis

so I know that I'm doing this correctly

[Music]

so closest Brothers okay that's it also

here's the inspiring Life by the way

that I'm going to

do I get to upload soon

[Music]

premium

I mean the lobbying

[Music]

my notes

[Music]

fine

okay here we go finally here's a game

okay

okay I was thinking there and there is a

search question right

[Music]

inspired already ignited

are they gonna work for spider Day

United treaty but

aren't doing sound effects FX must stay

modern changes I guess

okay let's check this

she's fine uh well right I should

write that so you can see what I'm doing

thank you

[Music]

start uploading

and

[Music]

category

NPC model

I think

Reddit who assisted you no one

is

my own

you do not need to select

Ive if you're already happy with the

character providing in traffic on this

but

now let's see is there anything mesh I

mean that's not a bad one not pink mesh

it's a bit more accurate there's a new

category 45

NPC mesh

I don't know

yeah

about them close by what language do I

have to there's no language for the

month conversion 3.0 also team name

brief overview and

remove stick clouds

and

that's in

um

spell it

yes

like back on the PS1 version or

something

PS1 sure

in this summary

let me then check

this

Radioactive

[Music]

okay okay

so I need the preview picture as one

[Music]

and I found that by going to local

but uh

yes

[Music]

sir maybe not bring out the window I

guess

a person

saved screenshots

Windows no editor you should love that

thank you

there's some pretty pictures of the

pandas

worked on

what is these I'm interesting for now

so I need to fix it

some days

very quick

ly

[Music]

no wait no cry

[Music]

speed running making a lot yes

it's happening with this I'm actually

happy with my sniping to succeed

what's up here we go

now when it comes to things

and spin shots

the panda

okay

okay

[Music]

I'm not like amazing at planning out

like screenshots

[Music]

pendants and that's afterwards

I'm just going to put there's something

together

this screenshot is like a meme

someone should add a million text to it

or something

thank you

[Music]

I like how they've changed

this works

previously in the previous version you

can have a selection and then you press

rap and then it will come right in

[Music]

I always do this other complicated way

I did this

[Music]

um

this is like this is

[Music]

a very simple pattern

now I will save that as

and that's penny

penny

foreign

[Music]

kids

should be a wallpaper

is it being melt I should totally take

this and make it up now

wait what happened here why is thank you

did I read something wrong probably just

something wrong cute

it would be yeah it's something wrong

that's why it's okay

I don't remember

I don't remember if I did

affected it I would say

I did this because notice implementation

and

yeah I guess another is that

so

sure he's taking part saving this fight

sorry if anything awareness coming out

this thing

I think the Audi should be fine the

video might

there's nothing to be watching Mr Lim

hitch

[Music]

keeping track of this

it's fine that's good

yeah I got a red signal

[Music]

it says the sailing of the document

that's

thinking too much

yeah I should probably not have done

that

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

[Music]

I can't sleep

I guess um

DB so on the Nexus mod that could just

up down this screenshots as they are

I should probably be fine

foreign

[Music]

so

[Music]

what's the detailed description this

month will

[Music]

okay

remove

shouted shorts

we shine

I'm sure I can stop

the basic writing this leaves off if you

it is

[Music]

that

how they weren't wearing anything that's

[Music]

it and then

basically a baggy way of describing the

shot

um

I'm back to Spanish

this time I'm usually not seeing this

kind of special events normally

so

[Music]

I'm glad that so many of you are still

here and

lurking of course but but still

I'm still thinking about writing you're

free to come up with

anything if you want the help you don't

have the help

I appreciate you just in here

um

it's a cool event it's a

it's a what do you say mellow

I don't I don't know

[Music]

and

[Music]

this

other Wireless still keeping

oh it's done it's finally done save it

it's finally done saving

should I like

it is

no no I just remember I don't see them

because I don't I just upload their

images straight from different so

carving even yeah I guess that's a good

way but keeping the if he ignited this

style

I don't know what more then

uh this spot

also egg correctly

detectors error on the red patterns in

there this

area

something you normally don't see

anyway

what are those Textures in correct there

must be some painted it and now it's a

huge generous but

but you don't normally don't get a good

lift of them but but this will correct

it anyway because that's how picky I am

credits mesh and textures I mean it's

DSD

editing part of the photo edit mode

game located

in your folder right click on the game

in Steam choose properties local files

browse that's why I'm doing it

open the folders

Falcon content packs and create a phone

called

till they're not

place the dot pack inside till the mods

and then mod installation location is

basically it's something everything up

here

steam steam apps comma inspiring United

Trilogy fans can content packs till the

mods

take care

and then we'll add more at the end so

that's that

and the same description there

and the same

part here

so

I do want

these two pandas

and pick it pump is so cute I want it to

be good

I don't think that's a

another girl

that's why there's a mod I've been

working on for quite a while and I still

haven't completed

uh is because I'm way too picky

this is of course an issue

translate

why can't it just give me

[Music]

I just think I have to go for 15.99

it's 16 hour

why why does it have to do that

it's evil

it's one pixel too much

and I don't like that

but I must delete this picture

you know some editing the picture at the

moment but didn't switch up the picture

isn't that typical me

I'm so picky about stuff but that's

making sure that's what I'm working on

is visible because that's a completely

different

I am really copying this that's how they

got this carpet

navigation

[Music]

yeah maybe I should make them a bit

smaller actually

I don't know

Maybe

let's make it 1400 instead

[Music]

like that like that

and in the back I kind of rinse it a

little bit but

red powder has been a hard day at work

hydrate now my hydration is empty

I've been hydrating too much

foreign

water or soda

yeah it happened to be

soda

give me energy

I will be back okay

I'm just going to wait a bit more on

this

today

because this one is more zoomed in the

other one

so what I will do

is that I will scale it down

[Music]

not like that like that

maybe about the same size

[Music]

[Music]

like that it says that

helps

[Music]

it's different

I don't know that means

[Music]

again

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

this one is Seymour straight from the

side so the head is large and the body's

notch

but yeah I think this is China the same

price

this it must be a bit much

[Music]

patients

basements

[Music]

visual Harden

[Music]

up too much

[Music]

town

zombie

13.

I am picking again I wish I could just

type in numbers just an option and

[Music]

[Music]

second like this

[Music]

okay

okay

that means duplicate this instead

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

still kind of large anyway

another call it inline I guess

something

can't say

[Music]

I don't know what else to add so this

will be this would do

back to the website

let's watch it

let's go

okay

our plant break is coming out

go and look over this one thing out of

place

[Music]

[Music]

from the palace

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

foreign

I have kept e

Square

[Music]

they promise

they're Advanced so there

it

is different from usually

you know I understand

it will be differently sorry

and and

and then

yeah I don't know what that's cute

but at least it is slightly more

[Music]

[Music]

I might be eaten managed to come back

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

and

that's still a little bit different from

each other

and like yeah

I just look at that

aside from

there will be closing they should should

still be

as accurate

possible activity United

version since

that's the cone

this mod

would be interesting to have like

an upscaled HD version of the PS1 ones

like

based on those exactly

my mod contains

extreme violence Gore no nudity no and

skimpy outfits bikinis underwear armor

or

eh

no I mean

there's no skin

sexualized content no it's not meant to

be that

swearing profanino my mod contains

character presets

because related to or reference real

world issues now

because I reshade the automation because

every [ __ ]

thank you foreign

then I was casting it yeah it's supposed

to add the picture here no insert source

image magic

click the upload

oh about

that she didn't show up the screen right

now it's just a click that [ __ ]

and that's in line

um

select these email palette inline air

and thus

plants

[Music]

there we go

they are pretty image well I guess that

should be an abandoned

must be less than eight megabytes or by

distance 11 meters

[Music]

it says that bit too large but in that

case

I just have to

half the size of it

[Music]

and also

not to be rude to this panda

I should cut one of the pandas

now the reason for that is I think I'm

more

an additional red pad this morning

I'm working on sorry about that

my usual is shaking it

thank you

take these two Palace from Saint Bangor

I mean I can't just hear one boy

special Style

I don't know does that work

[Music]

s it

is

[Music]

75 percent

[Music]

too and this one should be much less in

size it's 75 today

and then it's 50 height and 50 width

which is 25 so 25 of 75 percent

must be the same as well

much numbers

no one actually cares how much that is

18

less than 19 percent

or watches left

bye everyone

is the final

few steps

maybe a few people left today to the

artwork that's possible

funny

reducing people

no it's not your responsibility

I just had to be funny on my own

and I'm not doing anything about it

mod page header area

back to you

this

is something funny that means funny

you are a real comedian

of that craft image

maybe I should balance out their Heights

or something but I'm not

I'm not

doing that again

your mod images

upload an image here drop an image it up

like that I will

he's too large piece upload price less

than eight megabytes

okay why can't you compress it after the

airplane

[Music]

it actually much to ask for

oh people are coming back it's working

it's working

continue be funny

if gaining watches it's up to six it

went from eight times before and now

it's up it's working you had to write

[Music]

like your life is on the line

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

okay so thinking thinking

team

just scan this down

well I have jokes but they're not really

safe for work well good thing we're not

at work

foreign

well that's a shame yes

marking things that wasn't my intention

and no jokes

that's fine it's fine

I can't respect that

[Music]

it was really nice to take this like the

same one inch

and so the captain of a pirate ship is

talking with the new swabi

the one

is that that Pokemon

all right I haven't

selected uh

an umbrella too thank you

this is now

the swampy Saints

wait what do you think of her swapping

voice

what happens if we get you know

urges I don't know if I like what this

is going

[Music]

so sure

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

is currently awaiting authorization

which generally takes one bit

[Music]

they take like 17 hours one hours

[Music]

the captain says

[Music]

you see that's parallel there whenever

you get there just put it in there

I don't like where this is going

we can use it I am time except on

Mondays

I don't

this feels a bit too much for this

channel you know we don't talk about it

that's

where are my mods

well well that's great

uh the price is swapping but why not

Mondays

[Music]

well that's your day in the band

oh

[Music]

the weird way to phrase it to be honest

[Music]

thank you

well it's a weird chick anime

I will say that I don't want it when we

get to church there's probably a lot of

details I don't get about the joke but

you don't have to explain it

you definitely don't have to explain it

I think we are fine without

any explanation

[Music]

he wanted Jacks I said about spicy he

said to tell them anyway

I don't I think I probably did I have to

remember if I said that you should thank

you

thank you

and

[Music]

I have someone found it funny

horrible I mean it was kinda

get the shit's damage and

sure that everything is working properly

otherwise

this stream is over

Okay so

enjoy the rest of your birthday for the

one hour remaining of the day

I mean it was enjoying to do this and it

was nice for the people that did show up

even if it was a short moment

out of the full stream it was fun

regardless and I was silly to forget to

turn on the microphone for the first one

and a half hour of the stream but

letting you know that that didn't happen

and let's let's mark that under

technical

difficulties

even though it was more

user errors

of course of course I would I wanted to

do the right thing but for some reason

no one is streaming at this moment on a

Saturday

I need to find more people

because there's a lot of extreme but I

don't know there's people I should not

just

wait someone I don't know

so I will probably just turn off the

stream now and

probably go to bed so thank you all

again

and good night

everyone's tired

everyone has been here the whole stream

it has been amazing

so I will send I guess I send text

access

goodbye good night

a second

being here

thank you thank you and now I will

finally press
