to another

one

Adventures no

I guess that's to be a great intro

welcome Kitty nice to see you hey

and welcome everyone else watching

so let's continue

I didn't mean to others

so let's see last time

wasn't Sunday

feels like so long ago

did any others extra streams I did

so I got to evening Lake

that's me I just position of the

microphone

yes I got the evening like

and did not do

anything more than that

so why don't we start with going

and finding badly

and collecting some extra gems around

here

let's watch the cutscene

Maybe

[Music]

breath of Freedom with the humility of a

wounded Sparrow our genuflect to my

Noble deliverer

uh it was no big deal dude

after all it was hard I who let you out

who are you brazenly avaricious to

just

listenerside now hold on

laughs

one more perhaps at least

please do a fool me the sublime honor of

enjoying your visitation in the nearest

Future

yes

and again it cut off the

last part of the aspires well sentence

I'm not sure why it does that

I thought I

well I fixed the game so it runs a bit

smoothly

but yeah it doesn't look great maybe

looks quite good anyway

um

let's see how well

the Bentley Works without playing

so that's possible to do and of course

jump but cannot use a club

and this move doesn't really it's Korean

thing so

yeah

let's use it for whenever I need to

this is going to be very tricky

am I supposed to

yeah

is not going to move when these are in

the way he's coming after

yeah so I need to remove those

if they used to move the only way I can

do all right I pressed it

it's too late

there you go

let's pick up this egg

just laying around here

taking care of the seals

in the correct angle no it does not

try again

no

that's wrong correct

there you go

yes let's have another game

foreign

properly

last time I did the let's push it down

when I play series by three without

spice abilities I was unable to reach

Bentley so I didn't

really play the level

but now I don't have the basic attack

so I can still pick up gems

but

can't really break anything

doesn't

it doesn't have any

ground move

no jump

what do you cost

his jump is terrible as well

I guess that's all I could do

foreign

that's it

well there are other levels well at

least he's unlocked not that it would

have much because all those

are the levels where I can play as him

um close-up of bumper

anyway

all those odd levels where I will be

able to play as Bentley I'm not really

going to be able to

still not use the club let's first

continue with

Rosen

authors I assume it says

beautiful pump on it yeah you like the

elastic close-up of fun

foreign

welcome to Frozen altar spiral on behalf

of the ice fairies I want to Grant you a

special power and as long as you stay in

our world

I think the amount is changing our fight

because I don't think your outfit was

that

have some reason

is quite the delay before she disappears

[Music]

[Music]

no small elephants

we don't need that

I care too much about you

but

that was a smile okay how how do you

control this

wait what do you say you can use this

okay I thought you were supposed to give

me instructions

well in that case I can use this good

yesterday

thank you

that would be good

what was that

running into

invisible ones

oh yes empty

flushed face

what I mean

it's a cute bunny

let's continue seeing the thing I got

another

big thing here to defeat

really cute bunny

yeah

yes

snowman good

so

do you need through the level

down

that was oh that wasn't close anymore

that was actually hitting me

yeah you don't say

if only I had something to stand on

but I don't have anything to stand on

sadly

more eyes this doesn't look like ice

this looks like black snow

it confused me

okay where did you go there you are

okay let's use another laser

or whatever it is

I can take that out with that charge I

don't need to

I see heated up a bit

so here we got

spiders

he appears to be having some trouble

okay

he doesn't even look what the hell no

I need to defeat him

so

I can do a body blow and I can block

High

and that's my options

well I can do a quick care of this one

okay that's what I can do

tweaking up for the blow and block High

okay

it came as a little problem with

[Applause]

okay

foreign

[Applause]

let's kick him again

let's see if I cannot came down within

one round

[Applause]

good

I know I take damage

very exciting

Maybe

oh I did it in one round

kill point is that the defeat him in one

round

there we go defeat yet in two rounds

well I did this in one round can I get a

bonus School points on that

so at most two rounds not exactly two

rounds

yeah stop

taunting

so many small elephants

they're cool if I notified wasn't blown

it was very repetitive and orange

so nothing here I can use this one okay

I guess you can use it to play with the

elephants I guess

so on the top of this

which I can't stand on

but I might be able to reach that part

no I cannot

all right let's go I miss this

let's talk to

this box

no problem

and there's money bags who wants to

give a

entrance to the

chat eye sockey

thing

but

thank you oh my

God but due to knock

ah there we go

due to not having

you know ice power

even though that's very granted he has

power because I didn't get it

I can not

do that challenge at all

I guess I could no it's eyes I cannot

charge either

well I guess that's what makes ice

annoying I can't even use I can't use

any of my move I cannot jump I cannot

charge

and I cannot Lane

her eyes the worst enemy

but I hope you're enjoying

the

Adventure

I appreciate that you're here

and if the number is correct you're the

only one here I do find that kind of

interesting as well because

very fun attention

that's great

let's go to fireworks Factory because

that's this is quite a fun level

so

but I do find it interesting that it is

only one worship because I usually have

more but for some reason

every recent streams it has been really

low

I mean people are free to do whatever

they want I just find it interesting

your super great streamer

I just will start reflecting numbers

anyway

wait I have put two for us oh yeah I got

another one I imagine for the two

followers at the moment

that I am

making a move

so I'm getting very close to 50.

and at 50 fun stuff will happen

right I walked into the attack

this is why I think which applies to a

lot of games he attacks you don't want

to be active while

it's actually attacking

response

and then

[Music]

oh I can eat it

because it had me much though but sure

you love it oh

nice

[Music]

what I like you

I can't wait I remember when you only

had two followers oh yeah

it is

I've gotta come far in shutter it's such

a short time

it's true

this is a level where you can have to

use hover

collecting all these gems 1000 gems

well that's not like that

no that's it wasn't there anything no

nothing by there but there are stuff in

these rooms

thank you

let's connect those things

you do

where are you there yeah

I've been here since the beginning

I just want to say that you are doing an

amazing job thank you for being here

I'm really appreciate that you actually

take your time on watching the streams

does mean a lot to me

and you also helped me out

giving me confidence

in streaming

I can't do that and I can not counties

that would be still if that works

someone got in my way

I was just rushing through the room and

it just

so

that's just waiting there great

let's continue

it looks like I have to use the cannon

which doesn't have anything inside how

does it work

you're welcome your voice sounds really

cute

it makes me happy

but you think so because I wanted to

that's kind of like

the

design the idea behind

on phone she should like

I mean she is my personal she's meant to

represent me

so

no I don't need that

and that

I see pumpkin as a cute character

and

I do hope that

works with the voice

alone

fireworks

person here

the first name ibox person

very cute and beautiful voice button is

beautiful too

I'm concentrating here like you oh

well

I am on so I guess

give me so many compliments

hello

let me take out on here

I love you

it's a little long ago I went to this

level so it's nice to actually do this

other not only properly because you know

okay it's this person

that wasn't nice

no I can go so thank you

aside from throwing a bomb at me but

can you no no I cannot blow yourself up

this is a continuation this must be a

bonus from

if you love that

bonus room with name yes

ninjas ninjas

they are everywhere

no I cannot attack that one

flash straight into it

to eat that that's an eat

okay I got two with fireworks

thank you for

thank you not

the ninjas that's I appreciate that I I

don't have to

you do so I don't have to bag attack

it looks super hot you don't say

and then there is a bonus here but I

cannot do this one because of the lack

of Firepower

not lava

yeah

and he's here too he's quite the Ninja

no he's not an India he's uh

or something

other gems in here

no

which is

so you can get out of here

vortexes

they sure make some interesting noise

there are however

gems in that tunnel which I cannot reach

without flying but it's a

thing I can't make up because flying is

just jumping

foreign

let's pick up these down Jets

there we go

and this is what ponpon looks like with

the power wrap

and you can settle not bring the power

with you that would be silly

so

ready yeah these are respond very

straight they're spawning crates so they

shouldn't respawn anymore I hope

there should be a shortcut here

cute

when her bow and skirt

Lowe's in yellow

thing on the ground okay

passing through

Okay so

I guess they don't let me go see

but at least I didn't have to take out

the

big ones with the bombs that was that

actually I want to complete the level

without using clay

yeah let's get this

ready karate

yeah there was nothing else there

and nothing hiding in here

so I guess that's that

I want to push the button

oh that was that level

or as much as I could be of that level

without

pressing the

name button

very well played thank you not so very

well played of Hunter and I just

realized I should have done Lost Fleet

first well I guess I have to come back

for that I haven't been in here

he rebuilt the wall

well I guess let's go to last Blitz

24 they should do Bentley first and

doesn't matter which you're doing you

should do Bentley

and lastly that's the two first level

the order doesn't matter

and

if you cannot afford Bentley you do Lost

Fleet because you'll get gems

that was nice

can you please get out of the way can I

can I charge you any League small

yes I could

yeah

yeah I know I know

yeah I found it that worked

now I have to use the cannon

go

let's pretend that didn't happen

and I guess that's all I can reach from

here

now there's there's some jumps here

now let's proceed

I don't want to fight you

where does the ghost have a

torch

anyway

um oh yeah down here there are a lot of

substance and crabs

and more gems

and yeah let's clear it away for you

even though you don't need to work late

years passing through everything for

some reason

that's how you use it

okay I do need to use the candle one

more time

crap

hey what kind of edge was that

smallness I do like the small ones I

don't like the small ones I changed my

mind

I'll do a flying attack

aha you can't get me then

you did something

no just some random teams there

boy hello wolf welcome

another

pumpkin Adventure

depending without flame which kinda out

of context

that sounds weird

very happy to see you here as usual I'm

always happy to see you

always been makes me happy makes me

happy to see everyone show up of course

of course the more people that I need I

don't I need help

as long as I had to pick up all this

maniani

how about this

chat

how is the pumpkin

well

it gets better I guess

I'm traveling at the moment

yesterday makes me happy and also yet

you happy makes me happy that

let's get nothing here I mean and

um

try to be happy as much as I can

and it's great that other people are

happy

I wish everyone had option opportunity

to be happy

yeah and I started streaming and I to

try it out and I do feel better doing it

because I'm not sure you feel felt the

best

before

so it's definitely nice to

especially the having people to chat

with

wait how did I swim up

I don't think that's

yeah I don't think that's

I don't think that's how you're supposed

to do it I mean

it's not like I need flame to get up

here but swimming up the waterfall

I guess it works and that was a surprise

to me

it's a great thing

thank you thank you and let's see how

I need to know the controls

I'm used to be abandoned to fight a

piece I can't do that

I like I like the necessary

things to shoot with can I shoot with

something else

no I speed up with both but she doesn't

mention

okay let's resurface then

your submarine jump out

well I could still

collections

a few yams scattered around the area

thank you

it's meant to sue these stock things

stuff

I don't know what it is

but it's toxic enough for

the dying

so it's amazing that there is this

invincibility power up

imagine having one in real life

okay

there are more gems up here

oh they got both directions okay

so I could have started anyway

okay

so time to continue

oh that was the wrong one

I found

lots of individual chats

well I think that's all of the gems in

here that I can pick up

so let's get out of here

oh didn't I take that one out before

interesting green water

something tells me it's not really water

well

one thing's for sure if that came out of

my tab I would not drink it

I think you can be sure about that

okay

and then there is yeah here's the action

way you're supposed to get there

I guess my my way works too

not sure why they have programmed the

waterfall to actually be

swimmable as well anyway

but yeah

that's basically all I can do now I can

yep the remaining gems and that stuff

when uh Panthers forget it again

so

continued radioactive Watcher I think

that's the right word

radio water

um

is ready a radioactive water green

well I mean it could be very very dirty

water that's awesome yeah if

this funny looking green water drinks

it's

well that's

not the wisest decision

then there's this casino skip it Hunter

start freed anyway

how did I miss this one

wait I saw some more how did I miss

these let's sort of clean this area

I think I left a lot I miss this

when I tried 100 the game well the first

time I did it

with um this way

Charmed reach I do like this level

it has a certain charm to it

on the doctor

too late to call the doctor

well I heard that's how the people in

movies get their special power

yeah yeah

if you see green water okay her outfits

has definitely been changed by the month

I don't like that dress instead the

thing that didn't teach it and this is

also weird she flies all the way down

there and then disappears and I went

back to a conversation

that must be real right right everything

in movies is around

what words

yeah I think I think you can charge

every single anime in this level

is there any big enemy

I mean

there are big academies but if that's

for a certain reason

sorry king frog what is frog Maybe

like this this anime speak

I don't think that one

that's because of that

and we started

happy side

don't do that ah hello

again

died

is that a second death

the second death for this stream

and I have to start early

oh

I have to use more of my attachments

call doctor for pumpkin I don't think I

don't think there is a cure for death

it could be wrong though

that there you go that's how you do it

doing something

Arch moves

okay now

checkpoint thank you

Ricky

now

oh hello money Banks

yeah and my lucky day if I pay you I can

get up the stairs

thank you

such a lucky day

I appreciate the luck I have

okay

oh thank you you knocked me back so I

didn't fall down in the water

pay for steps

well I mean technically yes

you do pay for stairs someone has to

build them with some kind of material

the hairs don't come for free

now

I think that's expensive 600 gems

yeah what's the exchange rate between

gems and real life money

oh I didn't fall down yes

and then apparently

you can go up here

okay

and go ahead and get an extra life

by just walking up here

someone didn't put that one down

six out of gems I know my friend can do

it for three Three Gems or 300 gems yes

we clear about that

that's what's the quality of those days

wait what is it oh wait I took it down

the other way around like yeah I need

health

thank you

let's continue

The Three Gems okay those sounds like

suspicious stars in that case

I don't get at that point

I don't get why that water is instant

death I do get why most of water in the

level isn't instant death which

in itself is kind of weird because

spider is supposedly

but where are you alive

isn't it like get rid of you before I

by the way

you back

we had to have some enemies came back

what did I say yeah this

this there there

buying there there fine

I mean it works when you speak it but

over there fine

I know

there is no time to lose I have time to

lose weight

iPhone 311

I have time to learn second follow

through the level

should I jump that test

um

what yeah I got pushed

push this through the level somehow

into that corner even though I should be

able to stand in that corner I have no

idea what happened

it was why are you back again I took

care of you

okay that one is a bit tricky because

when you get close

unless they're doing like an continuous

attack or power

not keeping this big

in that case they're busy keeping them

big

but if they doing a non-continuous

attack or spell like moving these things

they will

just try to attack you so this cam is

quite tricky

yeah I like that

companies are amazing she doesn't need

the devil

I'm doing I'm doing some great so this

game has to cheat

okay here's another

why I need to

when I could stand on it

I understand why I can't stand on it but

yeah I need to be able to spit and the

seats to complete this level so I can't

do that

now why isn't there anything on the back

side the same as an obvious hiding place

maybe it was too obvious they didn't put

anything there

okay

oh it flew over me I don't think now

you're trying to attack me again

now

oh you did

and you're the one the only one who's

stand still

okay let's invade the castle

oh no

okay

stop being big

oh thank you

I forgot big ass I attacked

oh where did you come from

at any house now

yeah frog

there it is

can you stand still

okay wait do you shrink sometime

okay I don't have time to check for that

yeah

there we go

door closed so let's open it

hi Ami Ami I actually don't know

so it says the name once but I don't

remember

that's my

that's my intent of me making that

annoying it comes in the name of those

because I don't have health anymore

what what

are you doing cat

cute sounds I don't know if that was a

cute sound

well

are you trying to attack me

in that case I have to get rid of you

and here I don't have my orb is gone

just kidding I guess the kid is cute

no I can't do this either because I

don't have

missiles

and I don't see

and even attack the

turkey fruit

why did that case the other frog should

be back as well I don't need to go

Airport

I do hear a lot of frog here

so I think that's all the gems and 11.

so I will

exit the level I guess a lot of lives

but I don't think I need those

hello

hello Lolly makes me really happy to see

you here

oh my God no flame button yeah it's

quite the challenge

sometimes

when the enemies cannot be charged and

tomorrow is so cute thank you

thank you so much

I'm really happy with

I would turn out myself

of course based on my fursona

but that that might mean obvious

I don't know

that's how you know the game is going to

be crazy

[Music]

so enough flame that means that I cannot

blame anything in this level or also I

forgot the previous flight level so I

should go back and do that

but let's see how this level goes how do

you kill big guys without flame and I

don't

yeah I don't have the option to do that

I just have to skip them so obviously I

cannot complete the game hundred percent

but my goal is basically try to

do as much as possible just to see how

much is possible and the main goal is

just to get rid of the sources

oh

yeah yeah

but so far

because well the white white

okay

I did

it did go well until I said that

why are they burning

so much

have they eaten something this is how I

the tricky part the boats

I should maybe go with the boats first

buy something to drink

no

okay the Rings first

and then the bones

okay yeah it is possible

I just have to uh

do some crazy

okay

I always last one

nope that was the first B

now

you can do it I hope so

apparently I cannot

okay concentration now

there we go

I am getting better at this the first

time I expect to do this it went thermal

terribly

it's like my English

but there we go now it's just this left

hopefully I have time enough as time is

running out

here we go I did it

not much time left

oh but I did it I was afraid

you're so good

thank you

thank you and the race will have already

much easier

wow

I'm

oh no

okay

[Music]

so I cannot use the uh

Rockets not that I need the Rockets

anyway because they don't affect the the

the one in first place anyway I don't

think so

I don't think shooting that one in the

sixth place is going to affect the one

in the first place

and it would be in the fifth place but

yeah

yeah kind of get me in my way

no

I think they can pick

yeah like that

I think that was the sound of it

that that they take

damage if I used to start and fly into

them

no don't drop

uh there was I might

shouldn't maybe go for that star in

in the behind

now I have a rocket the rest of the race

I never have in the first place even

without using any of the Rockets

and only using these Stars just the only

thing you have available in the very

first race

the

I would say the the very first race

against the bomb you know the

butterflies is very difficult I'm not

sure why the first race is so difficult

this race

well not not if you do that

yeah maybe I should ignore that one

I mean

I fly faster than the bumblebees

compared to the butterflies

that was that is making this race easier

well let's not make a mistake

like that

and then ignore that one and just fly

into the ground

the fire after architect

yay

now I didn't want to restart

[Music]

I never realized this but one fun little

feet are so cute like you benefit

yeah I did it is spider's feet but I did

remove the claws

now I think a hunter's challenge

is just riding the boats across the uh

either wait what do you see

it mustn't be in this building

app Bentley nuts

I don't remember where it is

I'll find him

nice thank you

yeah

okay I actually don't remember where

Hunter is this is

this is silly

let's find him

I found them in the past

really isn't he

in one of these trees or something

no

you see

is that like

I don't see

I think I saw the sign when there is no

sign it's just understanding

around the main eye I think yeah it is a

bonus bonus for finding him or something

yeah and he has a challenge

yeah wait oh oh yeah you have you're

right there is a sign I forgot about

that

that's why I couldn't find him he

doesn't exist at mode because he's still

captured

that explains it

oh well

I guess I go back for that later

so what do I have left I think

is that I want

yes that is old

so let's continue to to the boss battle

which then went free Hunter so I can

actually do the hunter challenge

more

that's it I've had enough

and I'm going to send it out to destroy

all the dragons

here we go yes hydration time is

important yeah

I'm probably going to multiple challenge

rounds so watching the cutscenes every

time is going to be hiring

a cute bunny bunny in that rocket okay

now

and because the uh

thank you because the the release I

cannot use the play button

but because this boss battle is

impossible to do without using the flame

button

that is the exception

otherwise

so

while I have disabled so I would not use

the flame attack against the crabs

because they are they are candidate

without

Flame

no or anything else that is thrown at me

that I can

to feed with

nice all right

it's really nice

now

I think you need to pick that up

but I mean the red one and the game on

thick

as much damage

yeah it looks to be exact same damage

well it's a red thing green

let's shoot him

right he's running on nothing

okay this should be

that's that

okay it's going a bit crazy

yeah fair enough yeah I mean otherwise

nice block there otherwise the game

would be

impossible

you can't defeat the first boss because

you can't use blame on the first bus

okay here is the first person the first

part is so easy it's us me in the bus

during a bus flight

there we go

the bus has been defeated

[Music]

the professional but in which way is she

professional

I wanted to use their Time Professional

and as you can see my hunter is released

so now I can go back and do those other

things

but let's go and talk to Bianca

bunny

but I want to help you stop the sorcerer

I trust you Bianca because you look nice

okay let's go back to meet

the gardens because I skipped that

flight level

and let's see how well

that flight it goes without Flame I

Don't Remember

what items

I think that's a country Speedway

no I don't remember

the professional abundant by defeating I

don't think that makes C professional

rocket rocket money

she is the

captain of the rocket wait why are you

still here I thought you were supposed

to

yeah exactly it was just you're not

supposed to be there that was a strange

bug

by defeating the boss

I Yeah by defe he was I got that that

said that doesn't make you professional

um

so

wait what's this a secret gym yeah I did

hide one by important country Speedway

okay let's see what this was

I don't remember

unless you mean like the boss at

workplace

and then you the one who did oh yeah it

was the one with planes

and protesting Pigs and the track and

for some reason I think of lawn mowers

but I don't remember this of course the

Rings tractors or something

you know those aren't lawn mowers right

because they have

extra

I don't I don't know I don't see maybe

there's like a farm dude

skipping one

flying over it I didn't mean to jump

that far

so remember me wait uh Java hello yes uh

I've already done

at the panda lemon

so

but I did use a details your trick to

defeat the big enemies

because

I had to

I think that was pretty simple actually

the B level was

a bigger challenge

lawnmower attract yeah that's why I

think it is what it said that in the

patients anyway Let's Race the airplanes

actually

a rocket bunny reminds me of

no I started face when I tried to read

the messages

uh I'll get back to that

since there is a lot of requirements

here and then I'll

take knowledge

I take a quick quick path actually Rocky

bunny reminds me there is a Japanese

company called like that which does body

kits for cars interesting

I didn't know about that rocket bunny

and it sounds it sounds like a nice name

I'm interested in a company called

spanning something

like how you already associate me with

the panel level well yeah you can uh we

asked three people now I think while

I've been in the chat uh with only one

Rolex

has done it and he was amazing at it and

the fact that he tried the rocket skills

I tried and I succeeded I will say that

I got all except for one because I

forgot about one all the ones I could

take it as far as I know because I

remember you said that one in the cave

company

reached

no I I probably skip no I I don't

remember if I got that one at it that

might have skipped one or two I don't

remember

but I didn't care about bulls because I

could charge them

I need to check you can check the vods

for when I play that level I guess you

can see how I did

but you're already doing a no flame

challenge yes I've done I'm on the third

game now so I have to pay attention

I will if you have any better this

better this future ideas for challenges

I would like to try those

cars will be fast like a bunny but yeah

that's why you have the the bunny

company doing car cars

because bunnies are quick

then you want your car to be quick

so my tricks are useful to you actually

yeah

they were so it was a

so it helped me see how I was supposed

to do that

before

and you complete them here not all

challenges but

like I said only the the big ones who I

can't judge everything I could charge I

didn't care about

guess I didn't want to spend too long on

the level

but because uh two of those enemies that

this big ones you have to defeat to

progress the level I had to do those two

I didn't have any choice

so

yeah you can see how I did

and also you can

determine how many I did miss as well

I think I don't yeah so it was that one

after they extend the bridge there's one

in there

I just remember if you can reach

actually

use that one

before they extended bridge if you can I

miss that one

and then

the second one is when the one right

outside after you pass pass through that

area

I don't remember if I got it or not

how many times have you completed this

Trilogy too many times

on the original PlayStation

and the very nice to India too many

times

which is

kind of why I tried this challenge

even though it makes the game

Sometimes some playable

there we go

let's make champ

so now let's find now wait this

challenge

and this time he actually standing

inside this building

you're amazing I think thank you

is it true that I played the game too

much

okay let's see I can't shoot I can't

cheat with that no no none of the face

buttons are doing anything

so

what's a space car

ask it ask the question then you just

leave

so now I can't do that challenge none of

the Facebook buttons works I have

if or

so I have made a

made it so that

the flame button the actual face button

isn't

yeah

this is called

assigned to anything so the button isn't

doing anything

and now let's go to Hunter because this

one I should be able to do without

because it doesn't require any shooting

so even if I accidentally tried to Flame

I cannot Flame

but

the trigger is still assigned so I can

still use Flame

in those moments I need

so yeah I'm just here

I'm sorry Hunter

yeah okay let's go down the river

now you do is avoid this thing which is

very a bouncy but

a bunny belt

landing on that front

there's some extra jumps here

you can jump a lot and

not stay on there

we fish for long

makes it kind of easy

if it was

Morris

not that I usually jump with a boat

whether it was more react limitations

that you can't jump

and all of a sudden he just crashed

well I saw that a hunter is randomly

disappeared in the

was just randomly crashed

he hit Hunter the face was amazing

yeah he reacts does she always react

when he

attack him

can't consider that

sadly are there some other characters

like Bianca doesn't react

which is a shame

but Elora doesn't react so I'm not sure

why Bianca isn't

so

that's I haven't gone back and done any

of the

because Bentley cannot use his Club

because that's the flame buttons

uh

and bird cannot use his Rockets as

that's also the flame button

and agent 9 cannot use his guns

is going to be interesting

and that's it just like with bosses

if there's a level that has something

blocking me from progressing the level

which requires Flame

I will use flame but only on that seeing

an enemy

drink

[Music]

empty

rescue

nice way to go down the stairs

missed

let's rescue the action picture

I like no release

30 seconds

[Music]

uh no

jelly like ears

and her armies and kicking all that

button I just wanted to say

we should go stay but my homework's been

overrun by a rhinox since I've been

captured if you happen to see the

sorcerers tell her I'll be giving her

dancing lessons real soon you know what

I mean you bet

later

there we go

it's wrong voice for fun fun but

yeah I don't know if I should voice Act

the water really works well it catches

I wouldn't say well and it also depends

on which cutscene it is the the ear

sounds terrible

they are very wobbly and jelly-like but

uh

I am actually surprised how well it

works

because I didn't

okay let's see how well agent9 works

because I didn't really try to

get one thing first

uh questions

quit

no it's under

of course I don't have a back button

because

it's on the camera because I did invert

that chest ready

but not during agent line

so now

second jump I can use bumps which I

don't have any at the moment

and I can zoom in

I cannot walk what's the meaning what's

the point of that

okay I can't shoot I don't have anything

you should I don't have Emma oh

and there's this

a little bit more fairly here

ah you can't see that one

I can't shoot this one

I guess this is kinda working but

here that's one

but it's not going to shoot his own

I can't do anything about that

oh

I want to see if you could shoot this

but

now

but uh I was divorce of a bamboo Trails

he had some impressive aim with rocket

skills so thank you it is probably the

first time study information was used as

a part of another challenge

really

I could imagine them being useful

Ah that's not seen this one or any other

wait you can't destroy things

okay but I didn't expect that

so the question is here

which I guess I should let you chat and

decide for

am I allowed to well shoot these two

Targets and that enemy to progress the

level or should I just not do the level

because I don't have to complete this

level to progress the game

but

although if I were to answer this this

question myself the whole level is a lot

of Shifting so no

I will have to break that route

constantly throughout the levels

yeah

you can skip to the end of the level and

pick your pumps from there

should I but I don't

but only if you could are

if you complete out for Sparks missions

wait how can I how would I be able to

pick the bombs from the end of the level

after completing the four Sparks

missions

I didn't know that was a thing

inform me more tell me more about this

picture

because I have no idea how completing

Sparks missions affects agent line

well falling off the level

but anyway let's continue the Christian

Islands I did at least rescue agent nine

like it's interested

Parks missing gives you an extra hit to

survive if you jump oh

[Music]

you can jump really high and far into

all

so is it is it just normal that taking

damage and jumping out of the goo or is

it a specific timing I need to do

okay this is level it's going to be

annoying

I cannot charge those Chris I don't

really get it the crystals I know it's

not metal but they can't give off a

metal feel so I can flame them but not

charge them it should be reverse because

they're really tall and skinny

yes it's just normal jumping after the

good in that case I can't do this

but what I cut

do is shooting with Sparks so

that's going to be a challenge

but but I do want to do these Park

challenges

but I wanted to push them to like later

of the Stream

later in the Stream

because

it can be a very tedious work trying to

actually get to the end of the video

boss

the only relaxing pop wraps

but I will try

and then I can do the ancient 9 level

properly

well properly with with jumping over the

view and

getting the bombs

and relying on the bombs the rest of

them

you can still practice it and get to the

island but I'm not sure you can travel

back

isn't there

you can buy the beer Bears I sometimes a

bear instead of bear uh I think they're

not right now it's not embarrassing

you defeated Crystal on this here oh the

Bears here ah oh yeah

that's something we're still talking

about

the

you mean embarrassing of the universe

yeah

so you mean here

I don't exactly know how to paint

but

that's it don't seem to jump as far it

might be something I don't get

I

didn't really do that anywhere

that was it yeah and they collect

everything yeah

yeah I think they did that terribly

yeah

because it does

I mean jump that far

ah

yeah I don't I don't really get it

um

there we go no sound there you go that

was some

kind of get it as much

as I could

get back to that later

the barely jumping anywhere

oh

I guess they don't want to jump up this

thing

yeah very very could you see me how I

was supposed to do that

certainly possible but

I don't know how

let's continue to

without dying

without dying I say and jump off when

the times I've died now

one time I felt through the level I

don't want to count that one

[Music]

do you think now I did more than two

times

I mean I already said I know I've

counted two deaths at least so

okay

so there you go

missed one

now I think it's clear

now now I just need that Vortex so let's

go back

this activated the vortex or create a

Vortex I guess

spinning around the vortex

and here

we got another bear

oh

there we go that worked

because this one actually wanted to jump

that far

but otherwise they just jumped that far

foreign

did it okay that was pretty easy

but I'm not sure why the first one

didn't want to do that

thousand gems sure sure if the gems it's

not like I need them

let's

check this stuff

miss that one

and

that double skill

let's execute oh and this and yeah then

you say

but his back keeps piling it yeah yeah

now it's gone very happy now

and then

there's a way there is a way to kill

that bear without flame okay

anyway

show me it one more time I think

if I go to

and talk to this one all these should

stay up and not disappear

when I attack or not

okay

anyway that's all the Beavers okay you

have to do that again

the

trigger area is a bit weird okay but you

have to activate it

and the game is broken

this is as a timeout yeah but how much

is supposed to get back if you don't

activate it again

I can't really do like a

jump like that

this one is active

let's just go far enough away

and this one is acting

well at least there's a Vortex here I

can use

so I can progress

I don't think there's any well yeah I

tried to enter and visit you

but you're signing from I don't think

there's any leaves

no I'm not there but there should be

loose ones in here

yeah there's a few loose yeah so I can

pick up

you get quite the view from here

yes interesting music

oh

that's the end of the music

uh I don't know why that's signed to you

so much

oh this should be an egg here

up

and then comes the funny part

the explosions explosives

that's funny

but do you also need that key I should

have gone to the key first because it's

on the race and then I can jump down

it was very very wobbly

everything is made up

of jelly here

look back here I have

and time to fly again so I can get the

key

oh yeah and those platforms are up now

like they should have been

bad game is a bit buggy again

no surprise there oh wait I might be

able to get the

and let's pick up the key first I know

and I think he's not over there

and death is over their instant death

okay I'm back here okay

that was another death

I don't get why some enemies respawn but

not all I have noise

he must be far away

the key is located oh hello sign it's

not like I taught you

now

and this is what I guess this this one

was the last time

I just didn't pay attention to it

but I hope I can charge the plane

because it would be quite annoying

catching up to the plane when I can't

even charge it

oh that was not a chart about that bomb

not least that chefs I can catch up with

playing

yeah there you go it worked

amazing

now to collect the key for real

then bring it to the chest which

somewhere here

a very large key

so

I think that's

almost everything

it's like a bit weird

and like yeah and then this

maybe a few more of those Crystal cages

I could take out with the Bears

which I misunderstood the first thing

hey

so anyway this skills

it's pretty easy so far

you can see I have my orb collecting the

gems so I don't have to

run into them

for some reason I want to remember this

slide to be different more difficult and

it's pretty easy

or relatively I guess

now once that's everything except us

then I should be able to get back from

the start

okay let me see

because in that case this should be

basically three of these

hello

it's not attacking

this one something tells me to contact

this one

no if I go there

yeah I'm not sure if they can attack

that was pretty close but I have no idea

how this works

no I don't I have no idea if this is

going to work or not doesn't seem to

seems to be blocked on some way I don't

know I don't get it

that's a

other one that I managed to get rid of

one of the Christians I remember one or

two that was pretty easy

yeah yes the star doesn't work for

regular flying

would be fun if you did

so I guess that's all I can do

kind of a weird level

big gems

yeah

imagine picking up one of those

but for the one of those rewards how

many times larger is one of those

compared to

in terms of volume

but let's see if I can get that

1 million times not in volume

I need to pick a million that doesn't

no wait I'm no wait

again

a thousand

okay I really need to say

no a million is a good number actually

that means that you're saying that it's

basically 100 times taller than a

regular gem

can you stack 100 gems if my if my quick

calculations in my head is quite which

might be wrong

but quick calculation is that if you

make something a hundred times taller

that means that the volume of it

that is that is the halftime style

Hunters wider and hard times deeper

the volume of it would be times a minute

but I could be wrong about that

oh look at 25 and a five

good I can defeaters with charge

but those big ones I'm pretty sure I

can't

but I'll give it a try

I try twice

and I take that as I cannot do that

so I had that answered

and thus I have to

it's Garden gems

no no he didn't

we don't need a hot floor here

and there's the key

checkpoint

let's continue

to speak once again

and continue

drink

all right he can't climb in the middle

I liked its symmetrical

there you go can I jump around the

corner here

oh yeah okay

now I cannot jump up today

but let's go visit the kangaroo

[Music]

kangaroo time

hi Sheila

because Sheila can't still kick because

you kick with the chart button

and with the flame button

which is how

I wish it worked on more characters but

angry time is cute

okay

anyway wait didn't I get a gem from that

no don't move away

I need you

this platform despite looking exactly

the same as this platform

and they act differently

I love it when video games does that

and this platform I also acts

differently

thanks for the consistency game

I'm gonna have some form of

identifying

Island in front of it

identifying the different types

right now

and that I landed in the flames

and I landed in the

movie things oh that was quick

that was close

eat porn with a cap or what is called

foreign

because the Swedish word or cap is caps

and the reason why the word is caps is

because it is from the English plural

caps but it is singular and Swedish

which means that this Swedish word

also has a plural of it unless with the

Swedish plurals acts differently than

English clearance

better funny language trivia there for

you and the plural is

of caps is kepsal if you're curious

that's your daily random

Swedish trivia

you're so smart

it's just random

thank you

random language trivia

I thought I missed this okay there you

go

interesting right yeah

yes maybe

feeling the

void

okay now

as I try to get that one I got the bag

light it up

the air I can get to the end of the

level

there you go

Lara graft

now Tara graft I meant to say

and I'm just backgammon thank you

90x I need 10 more

10 more I have a

yeah the flight 11 has two eggs

dynamines I should at least be able to

get one more

and I forgot the hunting tickets

oh yes Banks again

oh that's cheating

you can't do that

I was I wasn't even I didn't even see it

I hopefully I remember that on the way

back

spawner on the way over here

they like to cheat yeah how is it even

able to see me

maybe the other one

lonely

let's pick up random gems

and I pretty sure I cannot use the

Stingray here because it requires flame

to shoot

I wouldn't be surprised so that's 2500

very nice number

thank you very much

but I will check I do have to check just

make sure I will not assume since

it's back

go ahead

another one this one

and here's more oh

there's more here

let's start on that is one more day

and gotta hop off but I'm glad I was

able to catch one of his streams and

your skins thank you so much for showing

up it made me really happy to see you

thank you for

uh whatever with God says

a recognition

a really bad at condiments

so thank you

really fun to see

people I see on other state and and

streamers as well when they show up

please it's amazing

this makes me really happy

so that's speeding that's speeding this

button doesn't do anything and no I

cannot do anything

well I went

and I don't have an option to quit

the next planet yes see you next time

yeah I'll try to show up on your streams

as well whenever I get time

bye bye

so anyway

um uh yes

yeah another I'm also terrible with

communication as well

ish but I hope to get better over time

I might say strange stuff sometimes but

and also and not being native English

speaker it doesn't help

so I think I think I got everything in

the level

attacking me it's not nice

yeah I hope I don't forget anything

I am forgetting it I am forgetting

anything I am forgetting something

okay another bonus trivia about language

in English you say anything and

something in Swedish is the same word

because why wouldn't it be the same word

but that's why I accidentally said the

same word that he propose

how Swedish Works can affect if I speak

English this is my favorite game

hello

or anything else you want me to call you

just let me know what you want to be

called

I'm very close to the end of the game

but I don't think I have anything left

to do in Islam

so I guess you can enjoy the ending of

the game

your English is so cute how is my

English

it's my English mistakes and

pronunciation in English words cute

Maybe

I can't judge that I let

your native English speakers

but I don't know if you're a native

English speaker

yes it's good I guess

I guess that's good to know I that gives

does help my

um

confidence

is the word

knowing that

but at the same time to be honest

it can also be sometimes to be honest

I can admit if because you very often

said Evie you can call him Evie

oh yeah Evie because

that's right I forgot I confuse it

because Evie is could be like a nickname

for

Evelyn maybe I don't know but oh that

was nice and so anyway

I'm just gonna say that you're very very

often say nice things which is of course

appreciated

yeah but that does

it kind of at the same time lose its

meaning if you always say nice things

and

it has a bigger impact if you say nice

things less often

but I just didn't appreciate the nice

things you say

so to defeat these things I do need to

speed which I cannot do so

I can't but these stocks I can

even though they look kind of big

where

they were they were wear a bit of metal

so you cannot blame them

I wonder if I could trick one of those

to serve one of those into the other

what am I saying it

please don't throw rocks and rabbits

and I'm not native English speakers I

have

I started or something like that yeah

that's the actual native English

speakers here is good

yeah I don't think they can like

yeah they just explode they don't

they're not actually

defeat each other so

oh well that's a shame

why did it fly through it

and it helps I'm losing health and I do

need health in the next segment

or another dog

because the next segment has those rocks

he's speaking of having health

terrible

okay I give my checkpoint

checkpoint oh this one came back good at

least I can get the two hit points

I need to press the button

be careful it looks dangerous

fantastic changes you said that before I

opened the door

but yeah this is dangerous

wait I took damage without having any

Earth animation

I took damage again without having a

hard time doing what

what is going on

and now I got the heart damage on the

death animation I guess

but I got exactly three thousand gifts

I can't stand those rocks fun nah yeah

I don't really get how you're supposed

to avoid those they have really large

heat boxes

yeah this animation the death animation

I guess

I'll just rush to do everything

that that worked

big damage once

checkpoint

okay I'm really bad at timing because

I think I need to trick them

Nike bait them to a pack and then attack

them

nice straight in the face

pristine

okay this can be tricky let's see where

do I have the button

so they are and bait them like that okay

that's about

okay let's go hi Mr Button

can you like not spawn please I'm trying

to do a thing here

let me run past you more Falling Rocks

because I don't think the Falling Rock

stops after you reach the end of the

novel you thought's annoying

yeah

e welcome cat Rollings

and you're eating I still don't get what

e means

he just want me to say eat maybe

or you just want me to be confused

that's fair too

oh I forgot the bait

making e sounds

probably craft yeah I can do hovercraft

okay let's do the riddle

if one Dragon lays one egg in 12 minutes

how long would it take for 100 yards to

lay 100 eggs 100 divided per hundred is

one so one times twelve is twelve there

we go so

I can do a lot of shots and I can

Strife I guess

there's so much learning in this video

yes I guess

oh no

oh that was too far

here we go

oh they're doing enough shots back at me

okay

I need to be more careful

okay there we go

I'm gonna

I'm gonna be surprised how well that

went

but now I don't have any

um

and I guess I just shoot like this

I'm funky strafing

yeah I need to rush out of these nope

there we go

Santa recover all the eggs the dice

in the hovercraft the Malaysian

championship

okay I should not forget about these

there are five on the main platform

and then there are five more

on these platforms

this will be tricky

okay

I guess that's how tricky it was

this might however be tricky because

this one is starting out in the open

yeah there we go magic damage and again

pick up some extra health

these hovercrafts are so slow

but she does sit in it quite well

perhaps too short

that wasn't even in the correct

direction

you can see her little tail the hard

cuff needs money power yeah

bunny needs to power it off with some

bunny speed

okay shoot there we go

everybody's easy

yeah there you know without taking

damage the second time

you're the first round between the

competition and that's awesome

well originally it says you're the

you're the first dragon to win the

competition in a thousand years

but there's also this story about this

world how the dragons have not been in

this world for over a thousand years

things

I think that's what Sheila says

drugs hasn't been in this world over a

thousand years

so there was a Wonder no dragon hasn't

won that we know we're a thousand years

is

nah obvious

getting lost private

no I don't want to be lost

okay

little time

no I didn't want the answer

with you

I didn't think I'm sick

and this one is about party style but

they have considered this so they do

have timers

so if the if for some reason get stuck

and when the time runs out he will

disappear anyway

and there's a few of those timers

that was a dangerous it's like

straight into what I wish you for some

reason cannot swim in

is so inconsistent can you swim or not

okay this time

we mean time now that's more like

running time

that is also a challenge

which I kind of did once but I did it

with no

okay I'm doing this wrong

I said the previous slide was too easy

so I guess the game is getting better at

me now

that's how you do it

I don't know if that counts it's

cheating or not but it worked

okay let's not go the path of the

Falling Rocks

I went into the past of the [ __ ]

truck

you can't take yeah I did

let's celebrate

no I don't think there's anything else

for me to do

oh yeah then they extended this platform

very nice

drink

um

so what what animals do we have in the

chat we have

eaten which is a cat

wolf which is a wolf I assume

a a cat Rollins which is a cat

who is a cat uh

potoro I don't actually know I've done

that which would be a portrait

and

technology which I think it was that

I

can't do that Center lollied you yeah I

remember the name

who is a bunny a rabbit as well

and I don't think anyone else has

written in the chat

oh uh

I don't know if

javar has an animal

or

if it shower even means anything

if you are still in this chat can you

inform us which animal you are

and I

fun fun is of course a bunny

buddy now I said bunny

I think I'm actually going to collect

enough eggs

yeah because there's two in the flight

level

and finishing Dynamite should give me

the last one

funny

so

oh that's on the tips nice

loading

I will take a quick look at if

you mean something okay it loads the

page what I do but I wanted to flame

that nothing happened when I pressed the

button I'm gonna work

this is a stupid egg I don't know why

they have again

anyway that's it all right Java is like

a screw a bolt or or the verb to twist

to basically to screw a screw

yeah I'm obviously not going to be able

to charge my feet and of course not

flame because that's not allowed

but I'm of course not going to be able

to charge these giant

as long as you don't look at them they

don't shoot you am I allowed to do that

I mean it's a stupid shift

I mean

which is

huh

this one apparently still throws at me

okay

jumped

and right into that Dynamite

I repeat the bunny died

anyway

I have a whole team of array

of course I respond here

call doctor

again I don't think there's a cure for

death

okay that's not nice

[Music]

see bunny fell off the bridge

she got shot so hard

with the

gun that she fell off the glass

dinosauce allowed to have guns when the

norcs did not what kind of

thank you

and this time I will jump out

but this one actually can charge

and it disappears

Anya and the extra life jar got wasted

somehow

I think it got shot opened but because

the butterfly was freed it's I guess it

flew away

but I managed to get into the water

now safe so far

oh you

Don't Shoot Me

oh I don't have my orb

oh suspicious

oh an egg

tonight I'm going to have a hundred eggs

just by binging the lemon

but it isn't anything you're crying

the history of some try

not

dinosaur oh no that's really it's those

oh someone's doing excuse me hi yeah hi

if you say if

if it's a child shout your gun should

squeaking

also quite slow boats

that was some bad aim no that was close

speak your Patty

okay I think it runs

cleaned out the water

something died

no no that sound like baskets actually

yeah

oh no the bunny got shot

and the bunny died

the rain

wait where am I

I'm at the egg

right yeah

I didn't get this checkpoint

put that mirror on past you

oh headshot

did all these dinosaur exist at the same

time

hey company you're free

jumping yeah

okay there's a swimming section here

it's Rewards

call the police the bunny got shot I

mean that seems more reasonable actually

but something says set set says

something tells me that these

foreign

something tells me the police police

isn't really going to do anything about

dinosaurs holding guns I don't know

I know I chipped

that shouldn't be kind enough playing

here

I mean that that's fine that's fine

how big hitbox do you have

Xbox

um

because if you land on the as I can see

there's a bunny head anyway

because if you land on top of it it

should be fine

when you run straight into it that's the

problem

oh I ran into the bullet separately

okay I'll try again

whatever class

thinking Android

above that

it's a five second

a lot of boxes

thank you

I did my best

and all right this was a summary and I

cannot go up it's here I need to go up

so now I got actually got 101X

and yeah and the engine 9 area is still

not open so I cannot do that

so I guess that's it for now

so let's exit the level

and I guess I'll do the flight level and

then

and then I guess the boss battle

and then

as you do

Hunter's skateboarding thing because why

not

in Los Fleet

oh there's some some bloom and and then

I could try the Sparks levels just just

to see how how well it goes

I will have to do the shooting in the

tutorial otherwise I cannot get through

the tutorial

but then

I yeah

wait a minute this is the internal part

is it

no it isn't

is it no it's one too little

I want I'll see if I can find the last

one

why are they so angry

I mean aside from me killing them that

might be

yeah if you have someone killing you you

might have a good reason to be angry

actually so

aren't you

and where are the birds

okay you can't find through the birds a

bit

come on

I actually got the last bird I just

didn't get all the arches

so I can

okay I need a better strategy

I need to look out around the area a bit

more

we're gonna decide how I should do this

okay I think I have an idea let me try

wow wow

it goes really quickly also

oh Mr bird Mr second bird

I miss both

I tried to go for both I mean suppose

okay can I can you not get stuck in Arch

what how did that that counts

I am doing this in a really weird order

why there's still two more first

thank you

I mean that one wasn't better and now I

have three left instead of one left

so that didn't that didn't work

um even though it felt like I was

picking Step Up all the time

I guess

it was worse

I go back to my original

or not let's do this

why did I fly past it

I haven't passed it

I don't

know a little control

lying

my other but okay

I think I have some idea for anything

like this

I shouldn't go with the sardines

now I can look settings

okay that wasn't great

and then I I didn't run right into that

rock okay if I do that a little better

it can work

I just don't

I just shouldn't think

Buffet less it will go better

it does seem that if I could get a new

run actually

I know

again it lagged

for us a slight moment there

and no turn and I couldn't do a

correction

it

not really

thank you ah that was my fault I do I

make mistakes too

it's just that

around

like give it lags as soon as I mix it

then

I I mean it works I just

okay okay

I have it now I have it I have it

it's like this by one flight level I had

to retry a few times but now I'll do it

I can run every time

this Arch is slightly off the ground

uh now I got this second third

I should get that Arch when I can sit

there

there's a second and last Ash

uh no

yeah perfect

because I got those two I can't get this

and of course the destruction of the

arch still has the Collision

and I just missed one bird

and one side even

I'll do it

I did it

take a few attempts but I didn't

have with fat

Anya and the hunter challenge is

and how to change should just be flying

no shooting

should be fine celebration time

yay

yeah I wish I had some

yeah yeah I wish I did some Channel

themes for celebrating stuff

give me some more followers and

never had any 50 I can

I caught that one

all right

now I cannot fly fast or anything

this one

yeah so

yeah 50 followers I have 42 on release I

just need two more 2.8 more

I can sign up for the so-called

affiliate program

yeah I shouldn't be so close to it but

how am I supposed to know that

I can't really slow down

yeah I'm gonna have to take too long

the ring disappears okay I see

maybe that's why I lost last time

okay dude

keeping good distance

there we go

I found a sudden it it's further back

and then suddenly just crashes for no

season at all you can do it from pan I

did do it thank you for

your positivity thank you for

encouragement

[Music]

great to have you around

but now for the race

I don't believe the music it's not too

repetitive

first

I usually want me to cut this

okay I guess that was fine

music sounds great is this

if you say so

I mean yeah I guess it's fine

just

maybe not fully my taste it's better

than no music I guess

now I had to do these times I can't

crazy

I guess it went fine maybe they aren't

too tricky I think some other stars and

some other levels

trickier to go for

better than elevated music I mean this

could be elevated music

let's put this aside about the music

hello my friend

hello Julie

my friend Julie

with the dancing dog yeah the Fantastic

the music

well oh what happened there

first reading bird

I screamed in pain

the wolf

with the Dancing Ducks

I got it when I saw that mystery

how are you

I'm doing great since you are here

it makes

me feel better to see

see people I recognize

hello speaking of seeing people are

recognize I recognize Panda too

Hello Panda

it's quite a surprise to see

I don't remember it was you were you on

the previous stream I think

I'll try again

I feel excited

seeing seeing a lot of people showing up

obviously not your fault it was my fault

I'll do it this time

yeah jump to the music

oh how about the emotes are working in

the chat overlay

I didn't see the full chat overlay

my current setup

I'm gonna limit it with the tools I have

at the moment

they are great and I have

done it correctly I cannot

although I did use a template

but I did put together the chat overlay

myself and it has some interesting

features of one each of of which one is

that it will also include alerts

such as followers

Dodge

I still haven't seen anyone follow since

I started using it

uh I have got any followers just when

I've been offline so

yeah I see any messages on

trying to concentrate a bit extra on

this race amount

give me a minute

a little minute

yeah be right back

he said all right are you back for me

I'll be right back

let's finish class oh

I'm proud of that

okay a lot of messages here

it's not a latch is great right is the

sound a lot playing industry

wait and we thought we're talking on the

same thing uh I do have sounded like

four followers and and similar similar

things like that

and then I have the activity feed so I

can double check

yeah exactly what it was

you can help

I'm sure but if you appreciate any help

I can get

I do need something more if something

bunny like for the

when and when currently it just says the

text on screen that's all it does

imagine my friends but I can send you

basically

you visit how I did mine

can't back

yeah yeah we could maybe

go over that

the stream possibly

then some send a private message

it sounds good I I do appreciate

any hand packing yeah

I'm happy with how much I've actually

been able to do on my own

it's it's been

simpler than I

thought

it's pretty much meantime yeah I'll I'll

try to remember it

we thank you for

bring your help

bunny time let's skip the talking

you did

well I haven't done it yet

okay this was probably

yeah as the title of the videos of the

stream says the no flame button so I

cannot press the flame button I can

press the flame button but nothing will

happen because I have removed the

assigned key

foreign

you've been doing it very well so far

thank you

and if you need comments too

I do have

yeah I don't know what commands I would

have

so this boss requires me to use the

flame button so I do have a backup

button I use in these cases and that's

the exception I have added to the

challenge

if

I have to use the flame to continue

in that case I will use the plane

well this was very disgusting

so let's start by 70s but

I hope challenge yeah assistant

a challenge

round I think or it's just challenge

no flame button

and this is basically end of the Run

I did

complete Inspire one and and now I am

completely inspired three

it's kinda

what do you say and the

anti-climatic using the thing button in

the final button but and the game isn't

giving me another choice I don't have

any attention to activity damage

now

I did however not do it Inspire 2

because you can apparently not collect

enough resources to even challenge the

the do the final battle

a lot of what you need to complete in

that game requires Flame

oh I I was expecting the other

collaps that that was the wrong

direction oops

okay one more try even if you think the

flame button this is

the other way agent time you don't want

it

hurt yourself

get away from me oh he's standing there

I was going to ask where is he standing

yeah I'm not doing it she will stop

eventually

oh every single one of those missed and

I got hurt instead

that was bad

all right

maybe they got the star because I let me

check twice

so it's meant for your face too

tell me some of those rabbits rabbits

there's some sheep

I'll be right back I need to send a

homework yay

done with homework I've seen

that's good

oh sheep

thank you

so many invisible difference for the

boss

now

don't hurt the bunny

and now it's in the next phase

the flying orbs a lot of them

no get away from me

the evil source

okay now

now I will

not applying to the lava

yesterday

oh it's

he he's taking

it's Target seeking

I need some sheep

that's not a sheep

thank you

probably need one more

it's good that she does the single

what's up

might be enough

and I got them another one so why not

all house

nice

oh yeah okay no I missed okay one more

hit

and here it comes

up

she came

that wasn't

now

the final shot

at the two Final Shots the

15 shots okay

I need one more

ancient time

UFO

there you go thank you

oh it was further away

and there we go

it has been

quite

undefeated

and good

because the hand is back

that hand from okay I'll skip the

funny cutscenes

it's too many cutscenes

oh my

yeah

yeah but heck of the parts that some

people like

I guess

kinda

you know

the adventure okay now

I don't care come out of the bus portal

it's all bosses these honestly other uh

you defeat you do Between Worlds it's

supposed to do in the world

so this down the bus with a portal

okay come here

really deep

we meet all the gems but

in the eight of us

and I'm passing

now he runs away in the other section

what's up

I don't know how much to count up to

pass him again

get your gems back yeah I'm definitely

get my jams back

can't check how much it should count

after if you count after one ten

thousand four and seven six

uh it's about

a thousand

do we have left

fantastic again

800

11.

500 100 there we go

and that's the egg

the egg for sale

I missed the secret

I got all the gems back

I got quite a lot of gems in the hotel

Flame

how many times have I needed to flame it

hasn't been many levels required me to

explain I'm actually surprised that the

fireworks Factory which kinda

uses flame attack as part of its

gimmicks it doesn't require it to the

complete level

while the

whatever basically the first level not

not a glimmer but the second level that

is inspired two

uh requires this shame to even progress

it's been spin it's been a lot there

actually don't remember where the secret

egg is on this level

oh silly of me

it was quite a long time ago I 100 of

the game

oh

this looks suspicious

oh look

it's a secret

that's the secret egg

and because the eggs for egg for sale is

not considered part of the

you get 100 before you get eight for

sale and I think

like for sale is nothing enlisted as one

of the eggs on this

I wanna yeah it's not least it's one of

the eggs on this level in the original

ancient nine lab wow so

now let's go back to last Fleet

the hunters challenges and then after

that it would be spark slips

so Sparks can take one additional hit

well I guess protect what additional

heat so that can do

agent 9's level

huh no don't hit me

cookie ghost

wasn't there

I'll take the long way around

I have no problem with that

I just

you said you could attack me

okay

and then up here

appear

oh wait a minute

I don't think

collected everything here it could be

wrong

Maybe

yeah it looks like I did anyway this is

the area I wanted to go to anyway

so it is

you just need to

do some

I wouldn't I guess it's not backtracking

because I never came this way this was

the intelligent way

I just didn't find the way to

get up here

[Music]

huh that's not nice

I went haven't you be taught and it

matters

oh and then let's continue this way

and let's take

oh sorry you kind of got in the way

oh you're back

okay

just in time

bring him out okay

from takes to get terrible use turbo by

plugging the X Factor which is short

button so I can actually use turbo

without a rise in silly Library I can do

that no problem

um speaking of nope

all right so much attempts

I'm so far behind though

foreign

second place

I got one of those

things to speak oh I got bumped

I'm the fastest Spanish alive remember

rocket

they destroyed that one for me thank you

thank you

yeah that was pretty simple

yeah

let's go on one-on-one

the feet are the crabs on the chorus and

beat Hunters so even though if you beat

Hunter you're still going to lose if you

don't get all the craps because Hunter

is a cheater he's a cheetah so

so I guess it's in this name I was going

to say but his name isn't cheated

his name

if that should be cheaper cheetah

imagine doing that in any other kind of

race

oh nice

not so nice

rocket bunny cheating cheetah

foreign

he's so slow he's just cruising around

you suck Hunter even that you try to

cheat his

he blabbed your Hunter yeah

how couldn't you believe I could beat

you I need to decide anyway there are a

few more stuff I can pick up here oh I'm

in first place what's first

cheating cheetah

there there we go I want now are you

forced to be on Escape okay I see

I want to just walk on my own more feet

apparently I'm not allowed to

can I do this now you cannot trick

but I can go backwards

okay

why wait why did I all right that's how

it works it kind of saves a checkpoint

as you progress through the level

so if you oh yeah all right all right

all right

ignore it

I take care of it later

a nice fade

I wanted to

do that

I was upside down

give it one more try

okay I can't do that but I have to do

oh hello Sparks

there we go that worked

and then I fell off

I need to watch it

how did that happen okay no more tricks

I'm failing the same job multiple times

now

and there are not nothing here to click

now

then in that case there is that single

yeah I'm left to pick up

which is why I got all these boosts

sorry about that crap I'm kind of got in

the way

oh

okay I kind of forgot to miss out on

area up there

thank you

and

how hard should it be to turn around

I just want to turn around

oh I was flying moving on the first day

there you go finally got it

I don't know how many attempts that took

yeah it is

I think that but okay let's quit the

race quit the race

yeah I don't think there's anything left

to do there

oh

that was the hunter race I was

so

um

it's been three hours now so I should

end this dream but

let's see if these part because I can't

do like a stream

yeah just Sparks I guess that's probably

just sparkling that sounds like a

strange thing to do I guess

thank you for best for teaching me basic

controls

I totally did oh Champs

out in the open

oh gems

uh how well will this level go

let's let's go

and this first part is a tutorials I

have to do what so it says

otherwise she will be mad

I'm not allowed to use that otherwise

this this move I can use with this one

will cost me that much if I use it on

proper enemies

yeah let's do it oh I can't

do both as hip time

anyway that worked

you'll notice

how many power-ups I can use because

they record a button

but

did I think I did failure

but I destroyed the mod

here we go fine

see I have to rely on the power upstairs

okay now how to actually do the level

let's see how well it goes

with the abilities I have available

um

foreign

crabs

[Music]

does anybody no this is that

that's right there yeah must be a limit

on how many crabs it can spawn

yeah I must get rid of some crabs and

wait too many crabs

[Music]

[Music]

another power up

and I need to remember was the previous

Proverbs are a second going

wow

oh [ __ ]

evil crabs

I don't need to care about you

without you shooting in the wrong

direction okay new power up

nice Loop

ah

where am I supposed to go

wait I will be

never got the key or something

look at it

that was a bit seller of me

I'm pretty sure I forgot yeah

all right pick that camera yeah I think

he when I get to the boss

you have to

no more power up

there you go

it's in the bus in here yeah

probably if they would close the door so

I cannot pick up any more hours

and you know

there we go

that's how you recharge

you guys should have

this now I should not have this problem

really it could help

I really don't remember all the

powerapps

it's this power up I'm looking for yes

then I should pick up the

old because the shield I might be able

to use around the bus

yes yeah it's pretty close

thank you

oh

I did it

I defeated the first Sparks bus without

using a plane I mean the plane button

was pretty cool

and of course I did not find out gems

they need to come back and find out yet

like

great jobs thank you

my previous satisfied with that

means

since I thought this would actually be

quite hard

but

I guess later levels are the ones that

actually will be hard

did I waste my time trying to find all

the gems

because I'm missing a purple one

love isn't that big so it shouldn't take

too long to find him

yes I was kind of avoiding since while I

was

oh there it is of course

so I didn't like Miss a jam out in the

oven it just didn't destroy this

there you go

100 level complete what can I grammar

said I should have worked the the next

one instead

now it has to load this world

work the next world

could Rusty keeps one step

no wait uh

we do have

oh yeah

maybe I should exit so

so we can say her thing

I actually don't know what happens if

you choose the warp 2 I would assume you

still get the bonus

which is that smart can be oh bunnies

gems further away

but I don't remember what the three

bonuses are

wait a minute why why did I go into this

level

okay no no yes the first the first uh

the first

level allows you to pick up Sparks to

pick up gems further away second one

this one

allows keep spark stabilities this point

that Treasures in the original

and which is something you can always do

in

in

I mean I don't want to right here

which is something you can always do and

reignited

so

you don't get anything but

I need to remember that I can do that

oh

no

I'm not doing so great

[Music]

oops

why did I respond

oh I responded I have thank you

I'll try to die

I lost my power up

okay

that makes things harder I hope

I can't answer the last one

[Music]

I'm supposed to go this way

foreign

somehow I missed a lot of them

am I supposed to

yeah I can't do that

I think I

yeah so see this is what I have student

I have to pick up the power up and I

have to somehow get to the

the boss without dying

this might actually be a bit tricky and

I thought

I'll give it one more try but

it is getting quite late here

45 minutes to midnight

so

not that I want to give up it's just

it's getting quite late this is quite a

late stream the time in times of the

streams I quite a lot

oh how did I miss stuff I mean it's a

green gem I guess the green background I

guess

so it's just a five I'm missing

so it's one of those basically you can

do it I'll give my best

okay so I need to keep this I already

took you what took one damage

and that was intentional

it

it's not intentional

I need too much damage

yeah

[Music]

nice

yeah there we go there that's

yeah no I can't do this

I know that

cover up anymore

I mean

a mess

oh the power-ups are back okay

this is stop playing around so much

better play

laughs

at these butterflies

my boys this one

a little thing to me today

of course I took two damage

can

can those back speed stay select voice

that one still closed

thank you

you know

time to try to layer out the lemon

it just had the spot but at that point

moment

a bit more careful now

it takes two damage

okay it was that when I forgot which

makes sense

yeah this bike's still stands there

waiting

this is about the place you're supposed

to help me

will helpful power up let's go

this time I got third and it was Zoe

all right I mean checkpoint thank you

[Music]

I did it

I actually did it

never said they're a complete

without using the flame button I'm

actually surprised that right I mean

sure I use the checkpoints and

multiple lives to do it but the first

possible

within the limitations of the game I

managed to do it

you did it I knew you could do it and

then she doesn't say anything because

the only thing you unlock from that

aside from the next sparse level

is the ability to lock her chips which

are

this third one our next extra health and

the fourth one unlocks two abilities

I don't think she says anything when you

finish the fourth level for some reason

doesn't trigger

but in that case he says that you have

the ability

to Sparks gain stability to break his uh

wooden

crates and stuff

but most people as far as I've seen

only unlocks that when I go for 100 and

then they already have collected

everything so they don't have any use

for that power up

but

it does don't go for 100 then would

therefore have a lot of stuff to collect

they

oh no no not this they don't go try to

finish that level anyway

seriously do I have to destroy all these

and clean

okay I have to destroy this as well

it's the power-up response when I die

I think

should be able to

step one

destroy this

please thank you

no let's try it

wait is there

there's that

oh I'm missing them

all right a limited ammo

foreign

[Music]

here

three two

there's extra helps I think he thinks I

have

yep there you go

foreign

don't remember when the buses

okay but I shouldn't buy

okay I keep missing it

there you go

so

I guess I will get a checkpoint before

the bus

and then I can go back and pick up the

power up

okay like this

that wasn't about happy

okay I can't go back and pick up a power

up

yeah that's going to be a problem

wait I destroyed everything

all right is that the camera sparked

a bit

I'm here to collect you

shooting at the wrong direction

even that one shot in the wrong

direction yeah I don't think I can do

this

I guess this is the

Europe for now

I might attempt this but yeah this is

going to take very long time and because

I can't go back in the level

as I cannot pick up previous power apps

which might be something they

intentionally did

I'm still happy with actually being able

to complete do you have the Sparks

levels without

playing button

that's quite kind of happy with that

yeah her name is Amy which was what I

was curious about before

so uh

thank you everyone for showing up

and on this journey

so

would I consider Aspire 3 completed I

did defeat

the sources which was kind of my goal

so I guess I did complete inspires me

this so yeah so they're still if I

should complete that level maybe I

should attempt the other Sparks level

they have the final Sparks 11. which

doesn't really give me anything from

completing more than

The Pride I guess and then there is the

agent line level I don't know if that

should do a whole stream about that I

could probably add a bonus dream

somewhere I guess

if people are interested in watching

that

let me know if you are curious

um

yes yes okay I'll guess we'll do that

something

in that case

so uh

end of string tradition

ER

how about we go back and Mrs Troy X

again he's still playing Dark Souls I

like last time

and he's a really nice person and

I usually

kinda

Peak

now what do you say

take a look at his stream a bit yeah

it's night

before I go to bed

you're nice to me thank you

so

I guess like

like

I can't spend

like last time yes yes right popping yum

dream if you will get it if I see funny

okay

so uh

thank you all and

more Spyro on Sunday

that's a good question I need to figure

out what I should do on Sunday for the

Aspire stream

and hopefully I come up with something

yeah I still haven't decided

yeah

well I don't have any more to add so

thank you all and we'll

jump straight to over there now

you come up with case ideas I hopefully

I can come up with something

yeah thank you goodbye

foreign
