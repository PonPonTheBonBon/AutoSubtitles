that do we have anyone here

and Rabbit's the beat hello welcome

so

as mentioned

before or summer I didn't mention it on

the survey

I didn't have a memory card insert and

scene selected

[Music]

as mentioned

before not on the server I got the text

to work

I Elijah Wood

Lily West

and Carol must

ignites but who the other characters

what is all three playing like this

we're too late looks like the year is

fixed last time the main many options

didn't appear and the text in the

intrading Apparently reservation to get

the textless face make the game buggy so

you get the textless into

thank you

but in that case you should rather

extract the bt5

she is just like me and get together

watch the intro again

no I can't leave her behind

I've got to save her

what save the Beast has been trying to

kill us

yeah that wasn't her enough so she was

being used by the dark master

workforced to hear a different verse of

where our voice for spots still

even though

I guess that's the ending of the

previous game and

he had a different voice at that point

must not sure why the text but when it

was perky why the text

in cutscenes didn't work but but text on

the loading screen works because that

should also be a text object and not

part of the background yeah I should be

able to skip these right

apparently not

can pass that's it

yeah enough for David Spade Sparks what

is it you want Sparks why do I have to

want something I'm just ready to begin

the best day ever now that the evil

psycho she dragon is gone what

Cinder

what do you mean Sparks whoa calm down

big fella gosh you're awfully tense

I haven't been sleeping much

you should listen to Voltaire tell one

of his stories that'll put anyone to

sleep

Sparks what happened

okay you ready

I got up to get some fresh air

since I don't sleep much myself these

days with uh the female fright hanging

about

since I got something hear my teeth

that's that's what I'm here anyway my

Skin's um

five times is on

now

come on we have to find her it's

dangerous for her to be outside I just

realized having subtitles is actually a

good thing or strange dangerous for

anyone especially when I talk over when

they are speaking ignite is said yeah

no time to argue come on

uh you'd be helpless without me

I better come with you

instead of taking care by the way I

better check that

somebody who goes backwards

they haven't really cleaned up this

place

seems like something

they will do coming back

to him

all right all right

I think I also forgot to set the

there we go

it's not working

thank you

additional design for this stream

I didn't expect you to pick it

as I didn't actually read it last night

yeah collector remind me I did and

shouted subscriber as well collect more

to unlock something

let me out

uh

the spider scene it's um

Cinder sync

quiet we mustn't wake them what I can't

hear you over all this snoring

[Music]

in the truth

those doors are quite loud

okay and then I get good oh

first cycle smash through the doorway

see now I get the instructions

my new days still have a broken door to

fix that not so good to not get amazing

today and then push X to jump up and

start a combo with circle

it is official across

okay

I did it

a spine oh yeah Sparks is now advised by

Billy wax theater that's nature

he sounded exactly like fry when he was

shouting

french fry and now I did that again

also I missed this one

last time

[Music]

you get to sit up there all alone

it's what you want yeah well the

characters from them is

Molly J fry

right here

where's my instructions

aren't those roots that I'm supposed to

break through

because I didn't kill this one we named

that technique

I don't think they explained oh yeah

it's been about me to do that

I didn't seem to explain what J stands

for

okay

James

thank you

it's dangerous

you shouldn't have followed me Spyro

it's good enough for me let's go see ya

don't make this harder for me than it

already is I'm just trying to understand

I'm leaving Spyro

I'll belong here

after all I've done all I've put you

through

it's nice

huh I do speak for yourself Sparks no

no your destiny is here

mine is somewhere out there for me to

send her I don't want you to go goodbye

if you're looking at spire

s yes can we finally get some sleep

around here

I've been only sort of half sleeping

with one eye open for weeks now

alternating eyes of course

it lessens the strain but I tell you

it's taking a toll hey what's up was

this twitch always there

Spyro you okay buddy

in Simpsons

[Music]

to his homet J Simpson with his middle

name is Jay

okay

maybe they do that same for Philip J

Frye

foreign

hello

I can skip this cartoon okay

so

how did that happen

wow

strong effect

goodbye spider

the effects where Austin was working

before

let's do it

that's quite a strong effect

why actually turns off

and that's it for this

section it does actually expand

yeah

energy from the time slow down thingy

it didn't do that

in the

laptop down here

I feel awkward as usual

but yeah it's virus should be pine tree

clear your mind spiral

let's get dreams like this whenever I

drink enough job before bed

with it

now rise up

at least The Firestorm within you

within you

one if one frame it

but now that a primal fire rages inside

you

show me you have come on

yeah

follow the floating cloud first

testimony abilities

press up to select the file element in

the future

now this guy's both sounds familiar to

you is it Gary Oldman

is it ignited speaking

it is

pressing home Square to tell you first

with

flames

I really don't like monster let's put

like one or two words at the second line

uh if you're not acting yet

wow wow sliced

I still believe

that what they should do with sometimes

it if it fits someone I of course write

one line but as soon as it requires two

line

put the line break somewhere in the

middle doesn't have to be exactly wrong

of course because that would be through

a word

and you can also choose which word you

want it to

first triangle to use virus Comet Dash

tag and charge three enemies from acids

now it just happens because

still nice nicely

because he might want to have the verb

to be together with the very

two is a verb but you might want to to

be go along with the verb that comes

after it's fun

it is

like the magical torches I mean isn't

this like what did she did before he

stopped fighting enemies uh Simpsons

first game that is

White

I really want to say is near

the only member of the gray birds you

can talk without destroying everything

okay

I think most characters in Skyrim can

talk without destroying anything

that might just be me oh let's keep

trying

I buy this in the dream again

I have fun yeah

and

I'll see I hope the picture is better

and

yeah the pictures it's not like 100

accurate color reproduction

I think it's like I don't know where the

darkest display light brightness is now

250 instead of

190 it was before

no because before it was very dark

red health bar instead of a Health

Energy

refills your green magic oh so now it's

magic

instead of breast energy

collecting blue Spirit stamps but in

this experience apparently will give you

the powers upgrade your breaths

we'll press the select button at any

time

let's go

I'll do that

oh

my God okay Bears cannot

speak because they're training in the

tomb isn't fully complete and they're

restoring the province with only the

power of The Voice

yeah uh yeah I really don't like that

I'm jumping in this here we go and then

this respawn

but the blue one does not because that's

energy keep

if anything they actually did consider

as a shame they're considered

again again I really don't like to jump

jump in this game

I think I have the strength to go on

people are leaving

have left I'm not that bad am I

maybe they came for the

pumpkin's beautiful outfit

there you go

teleportation what was that necessary

when you defeat enemies they will

release purple Fury gems fill your Fury

bar when they then press R2 to Unleash

Your

fire Fury

[Music]

is

okay

I'm what

a different Army there will release

me right now they told me that

I mean oh oh I see

to tell me that I should now press the

R2 button instead of just saying that

this game the whole text box again

because the previous game gave the

different enemies that we were supposed

to use that one Bill he has a five

column on his head

okay the chronicler is not a near

different actors

I are

on Aaron

yeah

you don't know

you have done well

now it is time for you to return but be

careful spiral the enemy approaches

enemy absolutely told me who you are you

shall know me as the chronicler

seek me out

but wait you haven't told me where you

are

in 15 minutes

foreign

Capital hairdress again

she's wearing it

makes up her address during the cutscene

during the dream sequence

I don't know if I'm watching half so

yeah

maybe I should just give them I don't

know

let me know people

[Music]

all right

for me early animals this year care of a

cave I guess this is showing how well

this is going to go

so I wouldn't mind watching that I must

have been able to do this last time

okay that's fine

[Music]

we go you are left on our next day on

your spider's flame press to break out

of arms

[ __ ]

in case I don't have that

many flame to use okay

perfect

[Music]

okay

perfect

I better be a bit more careful

[Music]

rocks path from this guy

what is that

one done

is it the right side little one nice up

I guess they just light up in the

ordering

yes that's been in order right now

it would be nice saying because they are

less fighting something

hey look at this

and then

which makes no sense

I'm supposed to use

the time slow down

that wasn't running

even though

it slows down everything including

inspire

but that's meant to just be able to like

this is

nope nothing is some trash

didn't see that coming

yeah and all right this one is it

and one of them was starting to decide

and saw

friends fall down and then you stood

there and learn as well

maybe this slow time thing doesn't slow

expire down as much as it does

everything else yeah

the only thing I can

die

maybe I should slow down time all right

let's do it

there's a Spider Concepts time slow down

hydrate

oh didn't see that coming

you got the extra point to spend now

[Music]

down there

inside things

[Music]

oh yeah we get to see anime names now oh

yeah I got who forgot that today

yeah

okay yes

destroying everything

we get out of this Dark Forest

yeah I played through like the first

hour of the game where anyone else

watching which is one other person uh

and then I can do this okay yeah it's a

slow process I really it's fine it's

fine

foreign

you should put something on this

oh let me guess

this is something I'm going to be able

to do later

to clean

I'm bunches

okay so if I like this

something else

that means picked up by type is actually

not

it wasn't a bad decision

and I did it fax it oh it's this one

foreign

how is that yeah

we should just didn't slip down Spyro so

if I have the right thing

that could be Allah I'm playing on

genuine hardware and not emulated

and

moment

okay I still know how business can

compare the wheat seed the strawberry of

course not

just kidding fish puppies

no as I said I said if if I were playing

on air lately I could have it so big

and also very fast

I could have it say eight speeds up the

game so as Firestone runs at normal

speeds but everything else is slow down

that would be something

just a regular thing

oh hello

oh that one easy way

yeah that was kinda

all right did you get stuck

that was the longest animation as well

am I supposed to go here

I mean there's level up here

[Music]

let's see before I level up

enabled

uh oh yeah can I press no of course I

can't press select from this menu so

this will fill it up halfway so far

I do like that updated again it's like

oh

running

this is the opposite of running this is

falling

let's do it

now I have to fight those dogs

right this is the place

yeah this is the place for the dog you

know what's funny in order to fix the UI

you have to restart the game from

beginning but you also had to restart

the previous game because that's gonna

set all the fight but otherwise Jason

will cause you to do stuff

a

[Music]

yeah because of course I had I don't say

anything anymore I quickly fixed the

technology

all right I fixed it

one of the cable isn't working properly

so

foreign

[Music]

I mean that's not about the actually

inside you

are poisonous juice

okay I need to open the store

sorry

[Music]

I mean that

I understand it I was supposed to attack

that enemy

it works

foreign

[Music]

I mean

honestly I think this it cannot

it doesn't seem like a great start of

the game it's too

it's probably because I'm not a fan of

the house fighting scene in the game

yikes

you'll be fighting this camera

I mean it should not be fun but it

wasn't a big one

and then maybe

yeah

there we go

thank you

he got hit by shielding's emotion

okay spider okay

yeah everything is done

uh

[Music]

[Applause]

dreams about Fancy

yeah

he wants to become a panther

I can do this I could eat

yes xiaomi Anthony

that's slow

camera and yeah

touch it

Sherry whoa

ready for opening door

[Music]

this still seems like something I should

pick up

there's a patience for dying

try not to die again

but I'm sorry

I didn't see

let's build this place anyway

oh Auto saving

oh yeah am I supposed to go down there

because

a cross cross and how's shackle to

perform our things together

because I didn't get these instructions

I guess there's nothing else to do

let's see a long taste right

wow

I wasn't ready

I also would like to see what that looks

like enormously I guess I could just cut

out that part and with the honest people

actually I could I could try that

this is an experimentation

if I both speed it up at the uh

yeah I do need to test uh

if I

no not that not that one that come on if

I just write that

no yeah it doesn't execute commands

like that

okay well that's bad

after I make

the Box

honestly

oh whoa whoa where did you come from

we must on either

Sparks kind of looks like the Honey Nut

cheerius being

I don't know how that one looks like

I wasn't trying to look at Sparks and

see but

I wouldn't be able to determine that

okay where was I supposed to go now

let's break the game

where is this there's some rocks anymore

maybe I did

at one time

wouldn't that be funny

oh I need to knock them all right

I see

I see

turd weed

I don't think having flames on a wooden

bridge is a good idea

yes Collision

all right excuse me

very proud

Greenbush

I was gonna say did I get anything from

that

yeah I should pick this up

foreign

health bar

cool

oh yeah all right okay and then

obviously question

that was some let's do it a little bit

back here

a bit

on there

thank you

this game is so Bucky

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

oh yeah

yeah

[Music]

if we didn't open that door which is

where I go through from 11.

00

[Music]

remake these three games and also like

in real life

foreign

ited to unifying a lot of the gameplay

sooner could you allow us to change

controls

but you have you have a mainly attack

but charge attack

impressive packs

and uh

Rush attack yes is this thing collected

no yeah

wait that wasn't the place it was here

and I'll also the fewer attacks that's

actually all right different things plus

jumps let us do the controls

that's what I argue for really being

able to Define controls

let's cut the kitty continue

[Music]

such something

I still don't didn't need but it said

that I got from this I can always check

back

at about later come on you're supposed

to grab it if you didn't take it up to

it

spiral

there you go

feather

ah it's a queen

foreign

snap final ready

guessing no more stuff

I do this

there are some nice clipping through the

whole thing

yeah away from everything okay Halloween

stop playing this

I'm just trying to play it again

I'm just trying to play oh yeah

beat him up

that's a lot of effect going on someone

oh I take zero damage

all that flashy effect ends here one

words to battle

and zero damage

I need salt breath for giant snails yeah

where's my salt breath

I told you

I didn't jump too early

just a little house back they certainly

made the game harder

hello Clyde welcome

enjoy some

Legends of Spyro where I keep failing

that's a bit of breezy

yeah fairly at the moment

where is my

recovery

can I use my breasts to convert it to

health

my diet

no worries good thing I saved it

no that's me

that's enough

I can use it to defeat some some of them

are

getting really test

but I guess it's working okay

let's see

why aren't you taking and damage

thank you

[Music]

I believe this makes some sense now that

you actually are attacking the Iranian

like the previous game

where this guy just died because you

killed me

[Music]

that's nice

position working

honestly

with so many things

can you can he has died already

the power of beating up the enemies

broke it

okay

let's see

so it only shows that it goes up to Max

yeah and then it jumps up like I see I

see

one

I could do that without the game

freezing this time

convenient that the wall use broke

itself like yeah definitely

can you stop running away from me

happened here

I don't know what happened there

hello

Bridge

bridge is destroyed

nothing secrets

like that

and then

running around

that was a nice combo wasn't it

I don't know I just

stop seeing it worked out

don't sleep off

I found something

accident

they're considering this

slimy things I was probably required to

playing this annoying so

corn

did flame all of them but they didn't do

anything

Secret

Maybe

let me take a bit about it around the

area

I like it

wait sponge you want something

you can't believe

I was a secret thing

okay camera can you

stop focusing on that scene

okay

maybe it's open to see here somewhere

else unrelated to this area

all right

really cruising

no it's accident

that's so easy to get stuck on things

come on

[Applause]

[Music]

oops

okay

that worked well

[Music]

all right he's not small enemies

oh one beginning

[Music]

to hit it once at least three times

oh

that was an amazing

that's enough

hey Mike you want some fire

okay

thank you

good mornings

and that was pretty easy

[Music]

I want to pick up some house but

apparently selling green one here maybe

I shouldn't wasted it on that I want

that

when it comes to this game I might need

it

[Music]

I stopped getting stuck on here

yeah you're technically not standing on

it around well that was all those

enemies and deal asleep from that

well it was all that

happened

during the outbreak

a lot of enemy fighting

the memory card remember crash last one

was removed no it doesn't but Sarah has

been disabled three names at once

that's not being removed

the game is buggy

I think he's like being set on fire

I think he's he likes being certified

that's what he felt

why are you 18 years

why did it turn green

I need to enable this thing I mean

I mean it is here it came with American

game so buggy

they're successful

very good

thank you for your thumbs jumping out

here

maybe so I can't come over like that

it's flashing faster so much

and then

[Music]

Kenny stop shooting me

God I must have maybe meant to do this

I just don't like how it's virus to slow

down

most of us are setting for that

so basically it runs became not that

slow

playing normal speed everything else is

slow down

it's a nice way to defeat the enemies

but

yeah it made me slower it looked like

that aspect of it

I also don't like to stop jump

hmm

nothing to put in there

myself

causative fashion

the game is paid

oh what is this

oh

oh wait but

[Music]

defeating them at the ball okay maybe I

can

roll it up for this hill yeah that's a

good idea

this is really Thai why he's being

pushed into me

yeah

I'm about to flashing in this area

right other private

that

this give it a good work

Fly Away

foreign

functionality

okay

oh

can you can you let me pass please

maybe I don't see that Jim if he starts

in them

thank you

okay

foreign

okay I do need more hands

[Music]

there we go Max down

foreign

mining

a jam inside

I didn't pay attention

[Applause]

continuing

do the back

it's very dark Forest that should be a

bit easier to see this time but

it's very dark words

quite strong as well

I still don't think I need it because

there's no enemy shooting at me up and I

need this

at this game you put it back here

okay there we go I did it

for instance right

can you get careful health

it worked it tastes ignitis

it's very back where it started

[Music]

oh there's a lot of enemies

foreign

good job ignite this nice tail slap

[Music]

are you so slow

[Music]

he's old

[Music]

ignite us

get down here

we need your help I was going to say is

this just someone testing out doing some

fighting animation and then decided to

put it into the cage

[Music]

fire press R2

all right

let's ignite this press started

let me use leaves

why

welcome okay this is how you do it in

practice and I've done this from the

start okay

welcome Izumi perhaps you can see

ignited spot inspired to come down and

help fight the enemy

and spider comes down and finds the

enemy and ignite is your sleeves

hi

what's the audio on the cartoon solo

[Music]

I'm still not sure if that's silent eyes

or celentis could be Buzz

so how's it going

Izumi

you're on your own with this one fella

I've been known

exactly or the one before that

huh something about preparing to die

silent device

range five miles

okay oh I do have it here

very stupid that the game

it's had to take damage but it collides

with the edge of the wall how am I

supposed to know

foreign

[Music]

and

um Target mode I don't know I see if we

call it another room you're on your own

with this one I don't know what the game

card is

oh I see I see

that press and hold

I just pressed and I didn't hold

by holding

nice crying

without doing battery I'm dying

it's funny that

lost

but it was comprehensible I knew what he

said and started the help too

I'm just gonna assume you said it was

great meeting you and have a nice day in

which case we thank you

is everyone all right I'm not sexy you

I mean after she actually because he

actually defeated Sarah and me so

where's Cinder then why did you leave

no

I can't see where Cinder has gone

just darkness but that's similar because

he she's dark so are they the same thing

you just need to zoom out of it

something is coming into Focus

Ed

till I missed and glue a tree I've seen

that tree in my dreams

only they usually feel more like

nightmares young dragon you've been

keeping secrets what is it you see

in these dreams of yours

I'm sorry ignite

I thought they would go away

but they only get worse relax but but

the dreams are embarrassing

as you understand that's why this is

Darkness

a mountain I can't get a life signature

it's strange now she says that

over my life

well

yes Sports

once and there was a voice calling

himself The Chronic word that's when I

saw the tree impossible

Veronica

what don't encourage him I don't believe

it either I've not heard that name in

ages nor hurts anyone well there is no

way that Spyro could have known

this is fascinating

is an ancient dragon of immeasurable

wisdom

though I've only heard stories

in fact I've had my doubts as to the

legitimacy of the tales

now I am left

why are you bleeding so much

several times a second

yes very tales of the chronicler

often interwoven Tales of Doom oh goody

afraid we might have might have to spend

the rest of the night without any more

Doom

it was only a matter of timing Titus

all felt it the great evil is on the

horizon perhaps

but we mustn't rush to judgment

this evening is brought about many

unexplained things

we may not have time ignite us

the celestial moons are almost at an

eclipse this we know for certain we must

prepare for the worst the night of

Eternal Darkness draws an eye

if Nai means soon I'm out of here

your instincts no faint of heart are

true we are no longer savior

this recent attack is likely the first

of many

the forces of the ape King know of

Spyro's existence not rest until they

witness his demise

demise

hate to be you

what you guys need to lighten up

I'm afraid terrador is right

as uncertain don't be scared none of us

can remain Idol and

watch our worst fears unfold before us

exactly we need a good hiding place

voltia you and Cyril must go to the

mainland to learn what news you can

tell it or make haste to the shattered

Veil and warn the inhabitants of that

region the darkness is spreading in

malaphor

I shall stay back in search for sin

these are dangerous times for a dragon

to be wandering about

May our ancestors look after us and keep

us safe

Dark Times

what should I do ignitis

young dragon you must travel by another

path and seek out the tree from your

tree

if the stories of the chronicler are

true

there may be hope for us yet

and I think I know where to begin

there is an ancient Grove within the

forest at the end of the Silver River

it is a secret place Untouched by

civilization

the waters there to poison us as well as

the creatures who are notified but you

shouldn't encounter any real Danger

trust your instincts

I shall be waiting for you here at the

temple when your task is complete

moistness worth it

don't drink it

that the game begins

have you seen that was before I guess it

was just a tutorial

and it's purple

oh yes loverly he always sends us

come on Sparks it's not that bad

well sure if you ignore all the evil

beasts and visions of Doom and eternal

darkness which sounds lovely by the way

oh and the fact that we now get the

Frolic through the magical creepy forest

in search of some stupid tree

what's not the love

you're psyched let's go

yeah that doesn't say

collecting this Spirit gems will give

you the power to upgrade your breasts

press the select quickly like any time

enter the upgrade screen and you already

told me that

so you don't need that

and a half

so the big dragon's names are ignite

this voltier charadore and Cyril

this time doesn't even sound like ice

or something

foreign

[Music]

sounds like guys but I sealed something

to do with ice or any winter like

stuff

now you need to get up here at first

and I do that bye

this thing okay

nice

we'll do it in the other direction

yeah I did the

Chevy got this thing now

oh no

fancy nuts

he didn't want me to go that way

to do oh boys in the river

have you seen such in real life are

there are these poisonous things

foreign

[Music]

looks like a shelf mushroom which are

very toxic and it's also a part of

floating through the toxic

Lake River

tomorrow

so fast

yeah fine yeah

okay that was easy

okay how many yeah

okay she just dropped it down and then

you destroy them and you just grab past

me

oh look at that speed

fastest thing at night

[Music]

Raven tracker there did some new

trackies okay fine spider probably

shouldn't put his pass anywhere near his

eyes

don't worry he doesn't do that

okay

yeah it's a tear shine

yeah

foreign

flat spider

think

the game looks nice it's

visually

nicer than

Fantastic Pizza

oh oh oh oh and again what's the matter

spider

me

swamp looking for a magic King tree but

correct word

very slowly in this game I feel like

because I used it before I got here

oh I almost said

okay

yes

he looks super cute I love the colors

that's great in here

I'm happy with the design

[Music]

looks like

a cinder's pattern

as a design thing

what are we doing here what are we doing

here I'm not even sure what I'm supposed

to be looking at giant tree

I think we're lost

hey have you tried these yet hmm they're

delish

come on try some

sparks don't eat that you don't even

know what it is

oh

nonsense they're perfectly animal

they're probably partly poisonous but

famous Parts

time to spread out don't bother snaring

anything smaller than a scurvy wing

stab only watches this time

and double the Bounty for them

hey this isn't right ignite has said

this place was uninhabited

you must have taken a wrong turn

all those in favor turn it back

go see what it is

not now

[Music]

so uh how is everyone today

[Music]

hey who are you calling a bug you crazy

[Music]

[Applause]

awkwardly

you died in the game it's cold oh it's

cold even

parks to God he can just fly up and they

can't

yeah because

Marcy's stupid hey I wanted to fly there

chronicler

are you there I've done what you've

asked of me

but I'm afraid I'm lost as long as the

spirits of the ancestors are with you

you are never lost

calm yourself spiral

and cool your thoughts I'm surfing cool

here

why is this do not let your Fire Control

you there are other elements at play

here

the power of ice also moves through you

just as the chilled winds whip through

your wings

let it

expand

let it expand

just being silly I knew you'd remember

life seeks out balance yantra and one

who can Master Fire and Ice is truly

powerful

in the shifting face of danger

you have the awaken the ice element with

the inspiring of positive floating

platforms Destiny abilities pressed down

select the eyes element in the future

was in the eyes and last time I didn't

move it

and it's this platform really necessary

Listen Hold

where the release to shoot a polar bomb

the longer you hold it up and down

further it will go

interesting

all right

let's try not to use the ice tail attack

this attack is very useful to knock

enemies away when you are surrounded

oh

oh wait

virtual diffuser

evil face the mystery

I guess they are

freeze themed

hey Carla I think our last concert here

are not lost here's the ice breath good

luck I mean

I mean yeah

sorry you're not lost just follow this

single linear path

this will take you

right you're supposed to go

okay I wasn't supposed to go there this

that's where we're actually supposed to

get it

I was just joking

I was supposed to go this point whoa

whoa

apparently you cannot run on those

things

[Music]

trying yeah we could be trying

but you're not going to make

hardly undying wait that has nothing to

do with

this

take care Christy hungry I think he was

just that was just lucky last time

whenever I raised him

the first time around

oh yeah they actually did showed us I

was just not paying attention

speaking of paying attention

third Shield The Warrior

[Music]

first of all the freezer

do you do you it's a crystal ball that

free say

maybe I should land on the beaker side

first

it's okay we can try again it's not okay

I fell down again

something roses to charm it

and I respect ready for falling

[Music]

foreign

I'd better be a bit more careful

yeah

take your time spider take your time

Sparks is only being eaten by brush your

thighs no hurry

yeah

I mean you know dreams

even though you like experience 10 hours

of a dream is only 10 minutes in real

life

[Music]

okay there was nothing time slow down

button

okay let me stand here then

I'm supposed to jump up here

oh

yeah it doesn't give me large

attachments

well that's neat

I want it to be larger without the spin

it

I don't like them spinning

okay I guess

loop around once

but it finally gets to freeze water

outside of cat scenes yeah

that should be unseen

I mean that seems to be very special

what they're not just regular water

but you it wasn't really watery in the

first game much of water they should

really let you do that and then press R2

to for the eyes Fury

all right

let's see this animation is spent 10

months animating there

foreign

[Music]

Instagram

remember this appearance not based on

okay let's do it whenever

no helicopter tasty no smelly nuts

it would be funny if you could do that

no secrets here [ __ ] you let's continue

let's talk to the chronicle again oh

blue and red I had some fire

oh

it works so slow

okay now what what is it you want me to

do

I think I'm entitled to know what's

happening

you already know what is happening

great evil that is Awakening

but there is more that you must

understand

I've seen this place before yeah

excuse me

this is an evil

Spyro it looks very rainbowy

Asylum to the wandering Phantoms and

lost spirits of those who had turned is

malified that would have a RGB lightning

collecting Lighting on their computer

well

hello

white screen

where is better now

CF River

where is this

Sparks

Sparks where are you

Spyro

I'm out of shape

what have we here

our first Catch of the Day

I mean despite

oh

so

after

that is

can be useful

maybe that's just jokes instead of Fire

thank you

Maybe

yeah so little I got from last time I

checked but I can't level up nice ones

oh yeah right that's the big game is

back as you say first

no

yeah

a rock of eyeshadows called missing

extra damage to your phone

because I am

dispersed force from the Flames they got

your Christmas service what kind of

descriptions are those

no I should use ice

all right

I'm out of breath

that stupid thing destroy the ice

foreign

oh

this is the most frustrating part of the

game the double jumping

oh well I better be a bit more careful

and also getting a tight fun you

responding okay it'll be assignments I

had four unsubscribed but

yeah I would have to say guys through

this energy

box doesn't want to know how spider went

up all the way out there

a spider doesn't want to know how he

ended up in a different place

the outside

I don't think you need to charge for

that

it's about poisonous reversing Patrols

oh

all right that's the eyes like I

understand

rice but

thank you

so annoying

nothing else to check today

and let me guess I can put ice on lava

and it's going to have the exact same

timing

yeah you come from here

yeah I did get

wait a minute what is this upside from I

can stand on

where are you coming from

annoying me

the back to where I was to this this

platform I can stand on but it doesn't

seem like I can go anyway

and I guess up there

I know

then on the platform my time

as we change

still on the platform and trying to get

update

all right that wasn't even close

then I'll say is this

yeah I don't watch slow motion

[Music]

thank you

yeah I seems to be quite useful that

would probably focus on this

I think what's the kind of place is this

now her son stepped from and starting to

cut scene but there is a pie chip

[Music]

I'll just stick here yeah wait why are

you following me

that was ice is so expensive

like that

[Music]

I did I didn't see the clothes

that wasn't the one I wanted to do

thank you

pick him up

kimana

wait

Jump Around

fancy creamer

[Music]

and finally

no

I think I should do something here

thank you for like showing me spice

I guess you're good for something

oh no I just wanted to

beloved thing

hey what's this

I guess that was easy

okay

check this out

almost like he can get after

I I was busy

I don't need to but I wanted to do it

over here

okay Sparks there I'm coming

wait where are you Sparks oh you're

there okay

this was actually a place I was watching

[Music]

yeah

I don't think I should start this class

[Music]

oh it didn't work

it did work

I know cannons

oh another boat

okay bye

students

going to slow motion

yeah I didn't want to send it in

foreign

one step backwards

but they

did all this great stuff

and then decided to remove the option to

disable slowdowns

25 matters until that was a big thing

in the first thing

my clock usually kind of like a

roadblock or something

[Music]

goodbye

goodbye

goodbye to YouTube

thank you

come on

phone damage camera

this it seems everywhere now

running out all these gems everywhere

now I need to go and clean up

nice one oh one

and when

oh come on

I guess I can pick it up this time

[Music]

not definitely enough to double the

camera

okay last box should I just fly over

here

hit the barrel he released a cannonball

oh

I shouldn't use the camera

let's see

is that no that's that button

oh oh no that's fine now

but I love this thing

like that it's really nice

and I assume I should flame this

I want to try

start Cannon

I want to shoot again

because it was fun

it was fun [ __ ] in the Canon

yeah

you can't fight

yep that was fun

anyway this should be

a mark of the second candle

oh

I'm sleepy

now

[Music]

are you

not another thing in me I used to fight

uh it's switched to five for me

[Music]

oh

darling okay

um

yeah I really need to be that excited

Let's Dance

yes it really got hit

ah really yeah okay let's see

hey that's that's a cheating

it's hot

foreign

[Music]

I better be a bit more careful

okay this is my my perfect Enemy at the

moon

this is cheating as well

thank you

I want in the way

okay there we go

I probably more of a strategy

where am I supposed to go now

this throw just ends here that way it

just continues here

[Music]

I hit continue to pass

[Music]

it continues here

doing obvious to me because I didn't

talk fast and green Gemma and today it

was there

after you had already ended

bedtime

yes we share it to that one though wait

the average is the one for the 100

fashion teams

I hope the artists which I mentioned

will get yeah I will

I have gotten any message regarding

that they started yet I will give the

artists of course

after the working started for like

finished that's definitely finished

uh on Twitch you can also link to the

artist feature

I will definitely do that

wow where did that come from

artify oh you fell down sitting here

nice

that's the quality this is expecting you

look at how this ice do I guess these

quite well actually

all right your eyes is good

oh nope still not enough

don't use ice and going

I don't see

since it would be a

nice bonus then

when I can I just annoying it no I

didn't like the Collision was weird

yeah mixing up the two

but yeah I want that proper chair on

fundament

that would be fun

I guess that way

yeah I think ice is good because it's

free system so

they kind of like attack me

by the death animation is still falling

down into the ground

all right

yeah that one is

this didn't watch where we're going

these two watch where you're going

then you don't fall

into the Q

is this a

H nope that's just shows how stupid this

kid is

supposed to go up yeah it was a loading

sound

that's just as stiff it is

yeah

let me know what emotes you want I don't

know how many I'm getting but

yes

so many details hasn't haven't been gone

over yet yeah can I jump on those except

when they're doing that electricity

thing probably

I don't like this area

do I need to repeat myself

funny game

I'm sure you'll get it this time thank

you for the

nah oh the double jump didn't work

I talked at the time I die is due to the

damage I'm not working

it's okay we can try again it's not okay

but we can try again

oh you can't stand on them again they're

free

let's try that why don't you try

shooting some magic out of your face

well yeah I I always thought about that

I will try that

no it didn't work

nope

so that's not what I'm supposed to do

no I'm just trying that all right let's

do it

I'm running out to Southeast

where do you find double jump go

[Music]

to remember my training you haven't been

trained in this finals

no more double jump the game tries to

keep it positive for the play yeah I

guess that's good but

it's a little stupid game

come on I'm sure you'll get it this time

I just don't like how did double jump

doesn't work

foreign

[Music]

let's keep trying please keep trying but

I am running out of ideas

at all

at least if the last platform us I think

I have the strength to go on that they

didn't

fall down as soon as you touch it

and we try again

so anything funny going on

come on I'm sure you'll get it this time

[Music]

jellyfish or are they Jam fish

oh you can't stand them

yes gaming stupid

oh I was supposed to slow down

I see

[Music]

hmm

continuation or is this is a bonus area

uh yeah this does continuation I should

get that thing I might move

thank you

don't fail me now double jump

started that sentence before I failed in

Dungeon

at least I should have got enough

checkpoint I gotta check all right let's

do it let's do it yeah I failed

so others than this game being difficult

what are you doing pumpkin

I mean it's

I think I have the strength to go on

yeah I did that as I said I I do feel a

bit tired for some reason

exactly now why

I did wake up

like

I think I got a good enough sleep at

least

well after three brands yeah I have done

more in there

I don't know why they changed I better

be a bit more careful don't know why

they have to change the double jump

perfect

oh cute sleepy bun

like sleeping bun

for some reason

but I guess then lack of pollution

helped me last night

I guess I had to check me about what how

much it adds to the health bar

oh wait what happened to the point what

don't worry just got blocked outside oh

hello oh hello two

thank you

ASAP you got some sap and I was in the

excellent I don't see okay

that's my fault

yep

the whole world freezes from spider dies

one words to battle

what if

I hope that one only thing is when you

failing about

oh come on come on

what happened

look out world

look out world I'm failing

I'm using the wrong pack again

[Music]

thank you

you're like oh come on another one

[Music]

all right there's somebody in the

afternoon

oh it's quite a big guy actually

[Music]

my house is certainly increase because

one he didn't

oh

really welcome back fill up the Empire

as much as I expected it

okay

hello platform

it's bright

it's no longer a turn oh

well

that's a bit excited today

and then I immediately but disappointed

you see that

I said that's what this game is

oh I see some are bright

and some are dark

the bright one can do

this something

with uh that instead of this

it's supposed to uh

that's what I'm supposed to do

[Music]

I see it's part of my training

there we go we're doing it

where's the uh this is just for a

feather I like it

another poisonous shell of mushroom

no no no no

no no

[Music]

oh

my God

I

did not pick up the queen

know how to see where I am on these

platforms

because there's no Shadow or anything

like that

uh double jump it into execute

this doesn't add back to foreign

hey try not to die again

what do you think I'm doing

how about

how about spider doesn't something

something what I wanted

problem is that in the first game it was

quite lenient so how you do a double

jump

in this game

they really want you to commit to doing

a w

very very early on

and I'm yes nuts

used it

right there

ignore the feather I get one try

there you go oh baby nice

all right

not sure how these seven ones can

shocked by her since he's impossible

um

it's very bright

[Music]

thank you

there's nothing to land on

the game realized the pushy buttons

yeah

I think I have the strength to go on

those things just show up straight again

his testing

come on

thank you

oh you're unfirst in the World Cup

surprise

yeah checkpoint so that was nice

so quickly

foreign

[Music]

okay that was pretty easy

what happened to the boat

well I should give him a decency

no problem

it's actually landed

oh surprise

[Music]

this one almost looks suspicious

yep that was suspicious

Okay so

jump to the forest

oh wait wait

oh there we are there yeah I'm supposed

to go to

I think

uh yeah spark says so but how am I

supposed to get up can I jump that tie

maybe I can maybe I'm us underestimate

is the double jumping power

I mean I am because he's such

hydrate

oops

wasn't my fault this time

can I take it

someone's taking damage

this place is a bit creepy

you know the world was better when one

scene there was evil

oh you changed his swimsuits sorry about

that kid and I didn't notice

um

well I do it now

I was way too distracted by the

game

is that your dumb tree it's beautiful

where we go now this feels like the

right place but I'm not sure what I'm

supposed to do here all right wonderful

I'm gonna go wait over there you know

I'll give you a few minutes

with a lily pad you forgot to sing on

Rainbow you can talk to

my Sparks even more dude in this game is

it's growing more and more reviews

hello I'm here give me a sign when he

spends such a long time reaching this

place spice responsibility

cookie

since it is poison River well it is

purple a purple swimsuit

that

it's my turn to pass out

Maybe

oh brother he's not your brother I mean

sir adopted Brothers

all right he's your brother

that's another one of these

is this how I moved I even reacted even

before the attack was done

I'll give you that

okay

you say nothing that's

okay

good job

I can't get hit

[Music]

he's touchy isn't

it

they're shooting the mouse

or something

no that was too high

a shout out for a fire spider

as a five breeding Dragon it's all right

seven seconds now

I know so he also takes damage for being

a binary

shooting

[Music]

okay he's already on fire maybe I should

shoot another one of these things

I see

okay

nice

I'm asking too much for inconsistency

[Music]

ah

foreign

oh

he did Ice

foreign

wow

that was the edge

that was the edge of the level

nice puzzle pass yeah and then you have

to restart the whole bus from start

because this level this game doesn't

give you checkpoints foreign

this is why I should do the uh

prediction thing

and now heels either

okay I can do everything because I want

to take that very very shortly

uh

well that's a very simple prediction

that you can do

ah

okay I can do that

I guess a very very short one

well I

take a short

short break

basically now that I know how I actually

saw the bus will I do it this time

or do I have to do

oh I'd be like will I fail it even

though I know what I'm supposed to do

that's basically

yeah

baby

all right

I guess no one wants to take part in the

prediction

hey

I need to adjust the

baby

to defeat these boss

I will give my best

I got

hey one person guessing at least one

person I actually don't see that

okay at least probably two people oh

well

enough

yeah I don't need myself either

like if I hit that I clearly hit that

why doesn't it count

yeah right it's like

yeah now it's counted

wow wow

yeah

let us try out

I need to touch

they should barely get in touch by now

yeah I'm hitting it

[Music]

I ain't clearly hitting it so why does

it count

and this time it can't

oh

that is what it was red

but it didn't count for some reason

again

I yeah I have to like hit it three times

or something

I guess I have to

but again but the thing is not only is

it hard to hear

occupied by doing that

means

well it takes a couple days yeah

it wasn't really clear about that

oh

[Music]

this bus is so uh

okay

this doesn't look good

[Music]

get away from me

foreign

thank you

anyway

see

yeah I did it

a difficult bus

[Music]

oh you killed it

oh I am the mighty tree two people guess

that I would die at least one more time

but

Journey hit her and then you get the

points back because no one picked the

other options

wait you don't suppose that was the

Chronicles

the purple dragon has been wandering

lost in the ancient Grove you're so nice

I already established statues

whoa what's with the gargling knit with

that Sparks maybe you should stay out of

this one yes mind yourself

answer your earlier question no that

isn't a chronicler whatever that is

that was arboric and it was going to be

the main attraction in our tournament

gosh I really feel bad about that this

bar expire not really no need to

remember even with that

with that angry face what do you mean by

that

um I'm feeling bad about that

that didn't happen

did they become Malaysian didn't

animated cartoon

yeah let's just show them the storyboard

we did we didn't finish these cutscenes

before I release so

this is what you get

Wing Low Sweet Chariot Coming For To

Carry Me Home

must you do that well maybe I do must I

do that and you know it might be just

crazy enough to work come on Spyro put

that sorrow behind you and clap your

hands with me

let the joy come pouring down rain on me

you feel it

in the kitchen just feel the love in the

room tonight this reminds me of this

Sonic storybook came

oh I don't know what you're talking

about actually I don't

it's a Sonic Storybook game

oh look oh yeah

is that really your friend it's me where

are we can you get us out

accuse me

they are made to serve Rock to this

scavengers

well yeah you have to get us out

didn't say the last line

and suspected easily has Judas bars like

at least the higher one yeah the corners

I don't know my roommate could be more

fun though

it's hurting time I really I mean more

than really I hate those birds

now so they really need to fix their

audio mixing it feels like

and this [ __ ] is quite forced to be

honest like

welcome to the first event of the

evening

tonight it brings you a very special

battle short of rental parts of

brutality

introducing a creature both rare and

Powerful a creature of Might as magic we

have high or sales and pasteurized on

spider

about to die I'd say this is pretty neat

nice they like to end up spider and the

Spiderman

oh that's the butterflies in your

stomach trust me I know

foreign

[Music]

[Applause]

oh

my God

attack this scorpion until it collapses

then finish it off without any strike

you mean

like I've done

wait

I can't you can't

start attacking me

this is cheating

thank you

[Applause]

this is something about a holding Circle

when they are

unblocking enemies

uh oh you guys supposed to do it on

peace now it wasn't me and I was like

huh

[Music]

nice guy but anyway actually I'm going

to say this whole whole thing on lock

your enemies blocking what's not a thing

in the previous game

oh yeah

and then died

200 people send this instead

like a spider died after

this thing happens

[Music]

this is supposed to be the first fight

[Applause]

[Music]

foreign

yeah this is going to be tougher than I

thought

oh you don't want the second one

is

so strange

ah Cannon you're cheating

foreign

[Music]

how about that

your beloved things are dead

[Music]

the Lord

yes

oh no spider again

no not again

now we should learn the Earth that way

no worry there's nothing to see here

it's all under control

oh yeah wait

um all right

this is right

that wasn't even fun

now because since in this game is a

boring spark and also spice isn't even a

funny character in this game

don't even try to make it funny it just

isn't

yep green power so it's earth power this

time so electricity lost

you've come far young dragon what

igniter said you would help but you've

only led me on a path to nowhere I'm a

path through life is not always the path

we choose

sometimes our paths are chosen for us

and it is our distance you must have a

good eye with the cannon hits

I guess

remember we shot The Killers I don't

know how easy it is to aim

steady spiral and use the power of the

earth to feel

s power

of Earth and nature is a mighty one

but as the Earth moves so does

everything in it be mindful

we'll see uh beer scared do you have

reawaken the Earth and land within the

spiral

follow the floating platforms the

testing the abilities press left to

select the Earth and my denotation

against the options are the same

a a chronicler if this is like your area

why do you make the platform in your

scene in the first place

the press and hold square 87 Earth plane

while you hold the button down you can

explain the player oh

[Music]

interesting

[Music]

and place the difference from the

previous game

what was that

okay that was interesting

oh I was supposed to do it

I've been stupid again I keep forgetting

about the Slowdown I think

let's keep trying I will keep trying

that's that's who I am

fungus

excited

I still don't know what a green thing is

supposed to be

a spinning platform can just as well

just come out from the bottom and then

start spinning

and again what's the point of spinning

platforms

press triangle to use the earth round

attack this attack is very useful to

knock up surrounding enemies so spario

can follow us through with an aircraft

okay

[Music]

so that's like the regular

attack in me

grass attack in the original game not

really not all the same thing but

can I see

this platform could just show up

from the bottom without that between

special effect

this game is weird

these spiders Earth flare to destroy the

Rock

debris the adebri

silent center of the crystal balls

switches then a full spin of your

airplane to change them with magic

nice work spider it's a loogie

foreign

again

the Chevrolet

next area here but but sure let's

teleport instead

defeat enemies to feel love feel your

Fury bar

then press R2 to Unleash Your Earth's

Fury I really want that a furry bar

what's yours

thank you

where's my furry bar

thanks

I want to spike inspired to me

[Music]

all right let's do this hip furry bar

yeah

and you like this this uh the underwear

she got here

is

that maybe don't need that one but

okay this platform can be still

hey Carlton there is this your place

it's stupid

yeah I said that your place is stupid

love

it's love for the underwear

I want to know what is happening I've

done what you've actually also got the

difference bra this time yes

but the time will come when you will

have to choose your own path

this part is

your eyes he signs are open

[Music]

another storyboard

why are they going towards it it is

their calling okay

like a storyboard Style

approaches what is the night of Eternal

Darkness

it is the night when the celestial moons

come together in a great eclipse

shrouds our world in darkness that

doesn't make sense The Well of Souls is

the Pinnacle of its terrible Shadow

stirring the spinach of the deceased

from their Eternal rest

and permitting them to roam freely

within the halls of the mountain if only

for a short while

and soon the night of Eternal Darkness

will be upon us

find me

in the celestial caves of the white Isle

I mean if one moon goes in front of the

other moon is not going to be an eclipse

I mean it's a it's a

you're not going to see one of the moons

but

I mean I guess it could because it had

an eclipse because one moon is covering

the other Moon different clips but it's

not blocking this sun did I miss

something

and also why is it called an internal

Knight if it's only for a short moment

I'm just wait out

[Music]

and his opponent

speeding liberal introduction

company is asking the two questions

about the game here I'd like to do that

I mean they should have thought about

this stuff

artists that metal

I'm confusing by and celebrates from

yesterday

there is another boss fight

assistant

right now

playing

I was trying to hurt my hair with flames

I'm I'm actually out of

Magic

which apparently this man you can no

longer breath so

anyone

wait what oh

no no

everything's going wrong all right can I

start moving before you start protecting

or something

yeah

oh no it's the Fish Boss uh

torpedo

[Music]

[Music]

I also need to remember these slow down

option which I probably should have used

against the first boss again why did

that happen

yeah okay

why does that happen

yes I will get this I am so confused

it's back for Revenge

all right so confused about me SpongeBob

but yeah so I said it's going to be the

same as petals

[Music]

except

it's harder and that's weirdly

foreign

yeah I don't think

it's probably dead already

a little extra there this time

okay right now

let's just spent today's very long and

slow destination

goal maybe now we can ask for a room

upgrade

I could easily be back there

we need to get out of here something

doesn't make any sense

and I was back tattoo I did that

actually

are in danger I have a message for you

from another prisoner here take it

Yahoo fan mail Yahoo mail

dear friend there are Whispers going

about the ship

word of your captivity has traveled

quickly expires could say like sorry I

can't read I actually not been taught

reading

himself has placed a bounty on you and

all of the dragons

these are dark times but know this you

have allies I look forward to the day

when we can meet Hunter of avalor

that was thoughtful I particularly like

the part about the dark times and the

dangers

it's showtime

yes

what greatness can you offer

ing out the Executioner

do you want to predict how many attempts

it will take to take out this

executioner

thank you

it's a three-phase bus

yes

I don't even remember what I

what I usually put it at

let's bring this up executioner

that you like they are this

I want to see this or plus this

how many times did I die

maybe it shouldn't be one to three days

maybe it should be more

you can see there's three face spots

yeah hydrange

I should maybe increase it to like one

to five deaths

because

I am going to die which was like three

minute option

if I can you can actually quit it after

three minutes okay

stretchy

so the Executioner is Big it's very big

has a sword

and armor has three laces

faces within codes it has three health

bars that might be like a three layered

health bar

as far as I could tell from those few

moments it showed up on screen

um

that's the hydrate

it's um

and I said this game is harder because

of if you die you have to start over the

whole boss fight

instead of just doing the part

one of the parts either continue like

yeah you have to stay in the previous

game you have to at least restart

the face you bar on at the moment you

write this game you have started all

over

and for anyone else watching at the

moment and

you are even if you don't chat you are

free to do a prediction as well

it's on his channel points doesn't cost

any real money

unless you are from one of the countries

that are not eligible for Physicians

which is

a bit silly because these are fake money

and as far as I know

that's the whole discussion itself let's

waste some time on that

prediction is not available

you cannot in any way on Twitch

and directly earn more points through

real money although to be fair you can

pay a subscription to earn points

quickly so I guess you could argue

you can get points that way

they get they get points through money

that way

um

it's complicated yeah it's consistently

simulated yeah but simulated gambling is

not illegal that's the thing

there are simulated gambling

in in other games it's just fine which

are sold in these countries

and

short Peggy requires put this on a few

countries in Europe but by the way Peggy

requires games to be rated 18 plus but

my channel is 18 plus at the moment

so

anyway it doesn't seem like anyone else

wants to partake in this gambling so

yeah it's complicated it's not that easy

so I guess I'll start the battle now

show me what you got

okay

okay that's one that's

so I do have this command so you can

now

huh don't look at me

oh

nicely done spider

he does not have much hamster

but I'm still failing

shivaya

foreign

no but

yeah

no but I mean the party that has the

gambling aspects

yes

18 plus

wow wow wow

all right don't don't do that that's

cheating

all right

okay I need to travel

I tried to slow down

[Music]

yes

I don't know how that

she's just married she disappears

that's it he turns really quickly not

even in slow motion could I avoid that

attack

I wasn't fair

yeah nothing yeah

I said

definitely a good idea to increase that

step one to five for this game

oh

I get to move before you start attacking

again

yeah yeah that move

foreign

[Music]

thank you

even even in slow motion that attack is

really really quick

the other thing is really quick too and

then I got teeth

what happened

well I am now officially

six plus cells

I guess you won

[Applause]

there you go

I mean I don't have that one but after

three gifts about winning

here

we have a special Bonus Match

a Bonus Match the spider the Dragon

versus

the former queen of household

[Applause]

perfect now let's get there still here

this party decided

smart crowds

[Music]

just like old times a Spyro Cinder I'm

not going to fight you relax I'm just

trying to put on a show for the crowd

while we figure out what to do don't

trust her she wants to eat me

what's happening

I want out

we supposed to pay what are you doing

I'm fine you can fly freely

but we were supposed to fight why did

they still sing their way

no no

since then

come on let's

I completely forgot about upgrades

uh no I think I still like ice the most

I still don't like how this turns into

snowballs

I guess I can do that

but

they roll away so easily

thank you

foreign

well it's been exciting

Adam hasn't it

since this does counted us now I am full

but anyway yeah

and let's

set back to Sierra and

because you need to start counting

something else

someone smokes I didn't see what was

going on here

I'll stand on it

more health

that I like

I guess I'll just continue here

I want

like I found three of the yellow ones

but that one's green ones because I

assume the green increases the green bar

while the yellow increases the red bar

I'm not sure why it wasn't red

I think things just got more complicated

good I was afraid that escaping the

burning ship will be too easy

it wasn't burning oh I see what you mean

okay camera why are you doing this

I want listen listen here camera I want

to go in this direction I'm supposed to

look forward okay

James Taylor

ah there's nothing like

if the camera is like this I couldn't

understand really you want to be like

this game

very annoying

okay okay

very quick that one

[Music]

speaking of quick

might happen what's that

eight one two three four five six seven

[Music]

eight

that way

he must really love this game it's like

a loud hitch

let's see four parts one two three four

five yeah I have issues with this game

[Music]

three four five

six seven eight nine ten

one two three

four

five six seven eight nine and

there you go

yeah

oh wait

I've got

a broken door

okay at some point

yeah I'll get you out there no it's just

a member something

it wasn't Goose I don't care

foreign

guys

let me take care of you first

give me anything

[Music]

I need my energy

I see they open the door and come out

from there I can't touch this spider

that means that they probably might open

all the doors

oh they have open doors but not these

doors

so I guess I'm supposed to continue this

way then

oh it's ah I'm back here

and let's continue this way then

oh no

I'm not the flute Tracer what

oh here we are

let me see if I can open this

well yeah the ship's under attack we

have to get off this thing attacked by

what

was that the creature that slowly seen

that they are attacking

and that we are not completely following

the story I'm just trying to follow it

you do that

but did she go

why don't you try shooting some magic I

was using Magic

this one is definitely

oh nothing

um

that's your heart to control me and he

likes moves

here we go

you're really going to be like this ah

we're really going to be like this

Lookout world

[Music]

yeah let's keep trying

[Music]

thank you

well I guess that worked

it's a game this it's

do you mean this game something else

yeah it's

it's really something else

[Music]

thank you I would have Overkill there I

think

well I guess I can just walk around this

oh but this is the same

nothing okay

[Music]

because that's that's sexy because I'm

not since okay

nothing

well that's the same

what do you want Spice

oh should I do something what am I

supposed to do here

I don't know

probably something I'm missing

[Music]

okay see

[Music]

writing on phone

your demos are still on a ship but at

least fire escaped

there I guess so that's the important

part is there something I'm missing

we watched with that book

oh wait

foreign

[Music]

grass on it

doesn't make much sense

so what did I do

that doesn't look good

that looks worse

I definitely don't want to jump down is

that what the boat is for

[Music]

eign

okay just gave me an idea why don't we

get off the burning boat yeah not yet we

need a map to a place called The White

aisle and I think I know where we can

find it you know I hate you right a map

on a Wi-Fi

yes Sparks we know you hate spiders why

are you hanging around

well I probably should go down there

could be sick

some secrets

ah

there's something there

yeah but how did I get to it

[Music]

it's from the other room

I'm sure the answer will come to you

okay

um

thanks for the um

[Music]

encouragement I guess you could say

[Music]

grass tracks the other side

see ah thank you thank you I appreciate

light spikes

oh so I do

yeah

yeah come here

yep

this thing is in the way

is that one done

time to get another day

off the cannon variety

now you can't you can't throw the balls

I'm sure wait you're my famous turn

it it wasn't that slow but it worked

still haven't found a thing on Green

IE but I got that one

I mean Sparks can leave any time exactly

most pirates yeah that was kind of I

didn't reflective when it comes by it

you know what

this

okay

what's this in third I heard that has

this interest first like why are you

attacked me during this it's okay we can

try again attack me for this interesting

there are some creatures in there for

them for them to eat

do I get to fight it again

yes I do

oh okay uh I remember that ghosts are

weak the fire

that's true right

I don't know if it goes type in Pokemon

but these girls are definitely weak

Safari

and just like with that what artist sing

masks I guess they are masks yes like

with those I get to keep it after

collecting it one time

everything

was not supposed to go through the floor

all right what was this what was that

cutscene they show me that this place is

up and now now in that case I was still

and they close down that area still want

to

uh this is this area what's this really

good thanks sorry

I remember

yeah

what's this really this area

I could take a beat I want the girls

thank you guess that and football was

um yeah I don't recommend playing

football with

Treasures

ah ghost

Marcia spring to return it

I didn't even get anything

dancing in it

the curved towels that is

let's continue

I guess I checked everywhere

[Music]

maybe this is something I wanted

something empty

why am I missing something are they

empty or touched this is not a great to

continue

huh

there's a thing here that's this thing

ah so that's but um

I was still curious about this

maybe this isn't a continuation let me

save and see

if something will happen

but it was nothing

not to really build it up like they were

supposed to do that and I see

it's hard to see due to how quick it is

maybe it is a tail strike it's more like

a butt strike

take your time

another one oh yes 11.

this is what I came for now I can go

home

oh yeah I kind of forgot about the time

I've been streaming for almost four

hours now

then

this is another one

oh is that one

[Music]

I know

spider

why do you why why are you bad in your

own game

wake me up thank you

hey yay you're so cute

seems like the aquarium has quite a

stream delay at the moments

yo come on why this

why are you bad

why are you so bad

if I see Karen doesn't help either

interesting shadow

foreign

enough that

I will feel

[Music]

how about that

oh anything okay there you go no it is

time you come

instead of Time stuff really messing

with my head

wait no

I can't Pretender evidence from spiders

perspective

it's a timestamp really messing with his

head

yeah I guess maybe

yeah spider hasn't been experienced

sometimes slow down for a very long time

twice

[Music]

and the

Collision system does not like it

it was a white glowing goose

gooey stuff in that thing

maybe they were starting to cook some

carbonara

starting with the cheese

yeah

you want to eat this

that was easy so let's just do it

sounds sweet

is this ice fire

okay sorry about the table I don't think

you need it

you can't continue There

another candle others can whether I get

a cannonball from oh as another Cannon

which I use there probably to get up

from

I think I got my answer

I'm just gonna say that was a bit high

but it worked

he keeps getting blackout dark

hallucinate is some guy coming

as South Dakota yeah

and this is how slow dancing is probably

part of his uh

stuff

so now I assume it is

far enough aspire to get up

oh hello

that's quite rude

what did I just tell you

excuse me I'm I'm in the middle of Five

Guys can you stop for the assassins

because the cannon can't find it

we can actually move it

camera down like this

all right

okay

wrong way

I did it anyway

he have stomach

what kind of camera was that

I didn't expect it

all right you're lucky

okay

oh yeah apparently

I don't know image survives

there we go good night

look at his Fades away

also this other thing is transparent

there was someone here apparently nuts

this oh okay that's a safe way to go

down

guys look angry this is Sparta

[Music]

large number of enemies

no

it doesn't have anything

okay let's do this then

really

if you're trying to attack spider when

he's like that

he's standing close team should do a lot

of damage to you

it looks perfectly fine

excuse me I'm my second year leader I

guess

no star what did you say

he has stomach

yeah how's that

camera

obviously it's like Sparks missing that

one

should I do with this cannon

let's try it

let's try it

let's try it

I didn't expect that

oh no

oh no

I didn't want that

here's the slammo to your advantage

spider

okay

they are attacking quicker than a spider

has to recover

huh

you don't get any no I did of course not

give any checkpoints

I give it another try

foreign

Right Far Away

[Music]

I opened for all enemies or something to

die but I guess they didn't

fall in love with you but I mean he's

standing ironic

maybe I was hoping something I think

I can help

thank you

very annoying

all right thank you first

[Music]

okay I gave it a try

about to get to bed yeah I'm going to

bed today I'm saving here and that's

that's enough

I'll try that yeah

I was continuing that tomorrow

[Music]

so

thank you for sticking around the next

hour

and basically the same time

tomorrow

I'm glad I'm glad you like the

yeah

um

stampede

I'm not completely happy with the agenda

but

it's good enough I guess

so

someone I have recently started watching

is currently playing a Spyro reignited

so that's definitely not someone I need

to visit right away so that's

no question about it

I don't have any funny rate messages

if you have any funnier to cure any

funny idea I'm willing to

unless it's like someone I have watched

for a long time I might have some more

personal message

this is my generic message

just copy and paste then

yeah basically that

yeah I said I very recently started

watching you the channel

so but she's funny

I think it's she

it would be nice if

we could Embrace and make I know

people to

things like pronouns and stuff it's just

more convenient for everyone

but anyway I don't have anything more to

add so see you

and that shoe

in a few seconds

thank you all

and good night for me at least

why is my audience working
