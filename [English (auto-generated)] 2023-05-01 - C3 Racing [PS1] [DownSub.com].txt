thank you

hello welcome to another stream

welcome nice to see you here

then we have

kitten here

maybe it's

showing up later

so

yeah this is the

I still don't know what is uh looks like

I'm the first one yeah yeah

[Music]

I think

this dream started quickly hi hello

kitten I was wondering when you were you

didn't say anything before the stream

but you are here within the first

minutes so that's good

so

um

yeah back

back to this game did

much

effective racing racing bunny

is impossible races

and actually continue trying

yeah that's what I'm facing here now

this is the new schedule

which I've talked about a few times

we'll start next week

so just finish up the empty

yeah see it's going much better now

yes thinking of taking a week break caps

[Applause]

and I'm in the first position

it doesn't count unless I hit first

other maybe I should I always think

something in here

but maybe I should go over to the

championship and see if I can unlock the

card not my

way it works

[Applause]

I actually don't know if you can unlock

I know you can unlock cards in

Championship but I don't know if the

chairs oh this

you can versus

it's not going great anymore

my only hope here is that the cars fall

into the water

okay sounds easy

unless in one One race they do

[Applause]

and batteries

is in the United States

like the Canyons I think

nice I got stuck okay I lost this race

let's move over to the championship then

in that case I don't have to

yeah another benefit is that I don't

have to redo the same two races over and

over again which can be more fun I guess

so I'm moving on to championship

I need to actually unlock this first

okay I guess that wasn't an option then

is the canyon up here

are you able to customize your card now

this car starts though

in reason why it's proud for some reason

even though the game is set these

kilometers per hour

I guess that's what you get when you uh

hard-coded the text

and don't make it in Dynamic I probably

have to switch to German or something

so but I guess I'll just try try again I

mentioned everything

I usually

don't give up but I guess I did give up

last time that was because I reached

three hours I think

okay well I can't tune the car if you

have experience with hard tuning maybe

you can help me if you can judge how I

drive

and then

accepting how I should adjust the car I

do appreciate that

the car sounds the engine sounds can

start today like I just wondering if you

just wondering if there were any details

where off-road tires to help you avoid

losing tracks on your third yeah

tuning part of my account

[Music]

I thought it would sign us also when it

possibly into the depends

well I guess it is pretty obvious that I

do run this on an emulator

yeah

but I do have

but this is the actual layer this carpet

to the computer

I don't know what's the topic is but it

should be completely as far as I know I

have the legal rights to make copies of

my digital content

and since I own a PlayStation one I own

I can do them at least one name and I

own up back what's compatible but

there's three so I should have

um the

place I can just

not only the that's the game

he likes it looks more sharper

I cannot say my Xbox controller which is

more convenient than the PlayStation

control

it can depend on game of course uh

playing killer worlds it places

controller with the d-pad tablets

it's more convenient

for this racing game I prefer his thick

top test which I can actually make

smaller hearing adjustments

that can also change the controls so as

I press the three years which is the

has been standard since I

visit The annotation three or

accelerating and breaking apart

one and two

that was done using the right stick

I'm moving it foreign

[Music]

it's of course possible to press a and

B2

it's honestly more convenient because

the trick is to be honest and that's

very salvation

okay should we look at the cartooning

then

I mean I drive terribly too I'm not I'm

not that good at racing game I will

admit it is

um

yeah I should probably first start race

that's otherwise I have to consider this

part

[Music]

so car setup

second change the steering smooth so

aggressive

and I put that arguing that should

increase explanation I think

which can be good for this track with a

lot of cornering

one point is so cute yeah they like your

outfits it's the additional since you

didn't get

the swimsuit routine wasn't used up full

so it's being used up more here

so it can be

all right cartooning yeah

a damping ride height I did lower the

right height the knife that helps

like stamping should have low or high

should like increase it a bit

going like Steps like this

yeah it looks like everything is going

in size of steps

except the gearing it can be you can

barely see it move

and then scary

the icon

so these are options

it's not many options

but if there's any setting you would

suggest

I'm

I'm all ears I think the expression is

and I have big ears

nothing for taking the

sadly not I guess the clothes is like

damping height and Springs

but now you cannot change tires

a cute bunnies yeah they they are very

white

but it is I do like my big cute ears

should I increase damping does that help

I'm just guessing

let's see

okay

is a customizable thing

yeah you can adjust every gear fancy

[Applause]

maybe I should

increase the acceleration in further

because

really kind of yeah I see it on this

and when it comes to places like it yeah

I only get like third here

but it's worth here

I don't know I don't remember

I don't know how many games this car has

okay maybe I can get outside

but then this happens

spice mine

no I got to push stuff okay

like

which isn't which is which for arguing

isn't that

it's kind of weird before

like if I can't use the I think like if

I put this on this

it should have

nowhere okay maybe we should actually I

put it on the wrong way around

okay

as you said that that's far game is

lower acceleration

obviously

close skiing means that the gears are

closer together that makes sense

they're probably because I have a spy on

the UK track which I promise arguing

Progressive as long stretches

I think yeah now I'm getting behind

games

that's stuck in there okay okay this is

getting better okay

I just need to make sure to break things

in that corner

speaking

why did I keep getting stuck there I

just taste

what is this track

I think this track needs a bit more

polygons

nice going there

failing at the very first Corner

probably because I have my explanations

I can actually I shop with them okay

let's see

yeah later adjusted the bridge bias okay

if you want your brake rear brakes to

have more braking powder than the front

Okay that's a good idea

let's restart

that that was testing us okay that's a

good idea

it's actually said put quite far here

already

so should I have more

foreign

is already quite high but maybe break

level you should

be how much break is applied when you

press to break button probably like that

that's too high

speaking of too high

I mean if I said this somewhere in

between I guess maybe maybe

let me go from there

let's see how it goes

yeah

[Music]

oh I see cosplay [ __ ] that was bad

more than a team but we'll see rather

alone

[Applause]

[Music]

yeah it's going much better now

probably because I'm trying probably

because I set it for a higher

acceleration modem

speed without such a route

I think he's gonna push oh

a little push was nice a place like this

this is the magic of this

I'll be a decision

well I guess I'm used to catch up with

them

as far as driving so bad especially

[Music]

wow wow

[Music]

thank you I had to catch up with the

chats I guess there's probably

something especially

[Music]

okay

[Music]

thank you I'm up a little bit across and

getting stuck okay

you'll need to break during your turns

otherwise you lose yeah that's three

wait wait it was wait during the turn so

rear brake bias keep running car from

Spring out but like to break now we'll

see that's done too much okay

I keep pushing this throughout the

button we're breaking that's not

possible that is impossible

[Music]

so okay

[Music]

[Music]

see if I can apply it up

please

my basic Christians

I've actually never had about that

I'm not seeing you or among this

in all my leaves

amazing day with all the tips

to make amazing games

and both are sometimes

at least it's nothing I can remember

your sleep shell controls

in that case you can print those buttons

at the same time

I'm touching the grass

and things go getting better

am I in the last position here

so well

it's getting passive so

it's kind of thinking amazing

[Music]

lovely

wow

okay

it's because you don't want to reduce

your RPM while turning because that's

slowly down when you come out of the

attack

that makes sense I guess

it's just weird that I haven't heard

about it before because it seems to make

a lot of sense

[Applause]

I guess the area is

[Applause]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

team

um

doing great

damn yeah yeah I will actually

you guys

and I'm not actually

doing better doing greater than before

doing great

because I'm still lost

um I must

a lot

all right

[Music]

in here

wow

something in the shop it turns musical

Studio I tried to do that in some

corners

and

I wish I could show you

mattress

on screen somehow

look at that

technically could

now wait I don't know if there's one

I think that does make sense to have a

controller

without anything of course

[Music]

so in this case

oh

you have any questions okay

[Music]

okay

and I saw the

conference

[Music]

15 minutes past

[Music]

oh no no uh of course it went so well

and then I fall into the water okay

there we go

and let's see good morning Hello Panda

nice to see you hey

I am currently failing at this racing

game

did

tachometer in the corner kind of just me

if you're pushing it yeah that

kind of yeah it doesn't give direct

input

because I could like

no I don't think I can show it

now there's no setting for it

I don't know I cannot find the settings

for that that thing

positive downshift to Sharp it yeah

but can I control it

let's do it

now let's replace this part wait

[Music]

now I cannot control these

in that case that's very many

an island is struggling driving as it is

at the water is bad

yeah

it's not difficult

I would like to thank you

okay

more manual control of the car

be like this

beyond my skin I haven't consider any

idea

no

and yeah

early morning

that's perfect

it is in the middle of the day here

because people are busy to networking

stuff

in the morning

why does the

statue does

I need to be more careful

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

both anyway I guess my biggest struggle

is just staying on the track

[Music]

[Music]

so

[Music]

now

Walker yeah there's no water in this

second

please

there's only one pathway

after this time

which I can't even reach because I spare

now

in uh okay one more try

more than one hotel

I got a lot of time trying

[Music]

I will eventually do this

is quite differently and it goes from

the previous

because

yeah

[Music]

[Applause]

um

going off the track

every time this control you want to down

to your green traction okay

if I should do that that must be enough

much enough

[Applause]

[Music]

okay

always into the water

I sure love to fall into that water

all right

[Music]

okay that position

I've got the eyes

it Sean's being pulled towards the water

[Music]

[Music]

okay I am

I'm still on the track

[Music]

[Music]

chicken

[Music]

living in the berries

after this race

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

okay I'm definitely doing better now

[Music]

ah the car crashed nothing like

foreign

[Music]

my face

[Applause]

because in a real racing car crashed

like that

I could really put it back on the wheels

they would fall back so far behind

in the realize where you have the magic

replacement card picture you're still

happy starts dancing

wow

sit there

still

[Music]

Owen I guess I have to pass everyone

again

[Music]

[Music]

okay there we go

[Music]

this down walls

uh

[Music]

thank you

oh seriously spilling pasta what do you

think here

foreign

[Music]

I didn't win but it was close

um

all right let's see

I gotta head back to work it was just

not heat break a nice foot

come by

I was happy to see you

good job and I think a second place that

is quite the Improvement considerably

complete failures probably

laughs

so I might be able to do it this time

so let's see

that's right so far yeah

and if I can't apply many of the

suggestions I think it's safe it kind of

helps

yeah that's about it

racing game so hard

it's easier to control

I get I guess my biggest problem with

this game is

to be too hard to perform

so after I conquer this game

hey

hey someone is going through me that she

thinks I think I guess it gets over me

definitely

and the car hike isn't as high as the

car is Anthony

I said the physics in this game is a bit

weird

okay I'm still on the track and that's

what counts

questions

[Music]

[Music]

okay

[Music]

that's

that's

fine

[Music]

why did my engine sound good car listen

trying to drive straight into the wall

[Music]

okay

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

I was trying going a bit more risky

there just to catch off the leader

but I lost it and stuff

yeah let up the traveling Sharpton it's

kind of like you do in real life

chapter life I would

I'm not I'm not racing in real life so I

don't have that experience have you read

a title instructions about 50

this game doesn't but that's more of a

modern racing game feature to even

though you're using automatic shifting

and which I do because I am that I have

a person uh you if the game still allows

you to manually shift

so you can do ground shifting

[Music]

stuff

[Music]

keep on track

lighting

[Music]

and I like collides with fails

that's not good as well

and certainly no one had anything

walking

I lost myself

maybe maybe

if I need to restart again

it's

17 seconds to slow cooker

Russia let's face back for Seasons

uh yeah

Austin

I would probably not doing anyways but

another challenge I mean I guess that's

kind of more cheesy

stand in the water section and push all

the opponents down in the water

[Music]

because if you complete the falls into

water the computer is out of the race

can you basically have to get the three

chances by the car otherwise you're busy

pushing that one car in one second but

yeah

[Music]

and if you manage knocks down R3 card

around five percent

that means that you're now alone on the

race and just need to do the three laps

without falling into the water

bats chasing it like that I don't know

even how easy it would be to nothing

down in the morning requesting well

yeah that would be cheesy

I guess it would be kind of a fun

challenge to try to do that Halal places

that was a separate challenge

no

[Music]

that I'm jumping on this race for life

48 minutes now

that's after practices

this is kind of what I wanted to give up

on this thing

it's gonna be on my skin now

he takes this long for one Rings like an

hour per track

and I'm close but still not beating this

thank you

[Applause]

I always second decision

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

why is it such a long distance between

me

um first and second air

[Applause]

all other AIS are you know group

together except for these areas

with everyone's

[Music]

[Music]

you test me I was thinking this

is because uh

was distracted by the lagging games

because when I look at it because I can

see the string as well and then it seems

like it's lagging but it doesn't say

that it's dropping in French I'm not

sure what's gonna happen

mistake

the four elements

[Music]

we couldn't be able to catch up

[Music]

I was catching up

and then I messed up

[Applause]

another expression that contains the

word up

[Music]

and as soon as the distance marker

disappears that's fine

[Music]

it's not

one

[Music]

well I'm certainly getting better at

this

I feel like I'm going to do it soon I

want this drifting inside

I'll try drifting that's a good option

remember drift to be a good option

that's like it lives in fashion

it doesn't seem to be a good option I

should rearranged

re rates

yeah I'll try again

I'll try and try again

it's like a it's like watching speedrun

trying the same thing over and over

again until let's succeed

and when I finally succeed

I feel like

I don't know

increase one step or something I'm gonna

erase experimenting at this point

that's I want to place your song

there's

nothing

until I click there is

[Applause]

started from the same song

okay let me try this

maybe I put it

more like

been by a lot or just a few steps

all right

[Music]

[Music]

we've got that soon

yeah

let's take

all right

now

okay

when no then when you're turning you hit

the brakes the front end will slow down

faster than the rear end and it is oh

that's what you're looking for

the handbrake

and it's just a matter of how the James

physics and Shanghai is different

yeah that's this one

I would have trust this physics engine

Studio

but it's kind of

I'm sure

[Music]

the uh

games that are very accurate to this

simulation and then there are these

arcades racing games which do all kinds

of processing like boosting

action drifting that gives you speed it

actually accelerates the car

and and of course the market items

that's

because it's not nice

and that's that's too much of a facing

game

well

but I like the kind of in-between which

is like real racing but it's not

accurate simulation

like passion racing game

uh I do have a

Formula One game kind of later one

I got for sure

one thing something

[Applause]

but that one is very simulating

huh

doesn't this is easy

[Music]

[Music]

let's see how three cups which is good

huh oh yeah

of course in the tunnel now

it's not like erasing yeah

it's more like athletic

where

but I guess it's

she can be one of those we call it yeah

green carrots

back

oh she she dresses like that when she

raises

[ __ ] challenge

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

not so much

for parts so I can animate it

and then as I draw these different body

parts I can also give them a different

outfits at the same time

ah look at which position I am in

because some

driver couldn't stay on the road

this means I fight and I'm past the

water section

where I'm just 100 inside here

so it's catching out but I think I'm

going to win this

this time but

I win is a win and a computer shade to

stay on the track so

[Music]

and there we go where's the celebrations

whoa winner

[Music]

how about that

where's kitten he needs to be here to

celebrate I'm going to say this time

this means I can now

they're attractive

stand on your car I guess that's every

other track I get any car so

[Music]

I'll pop open the champagne yeah oh no

it's raining it's going to be even

slippery

yeah let's let's have some charm thing

and this is reverse things

I wouldn't drink it though but I guess

just

situations

[Applause]

no no no

refresh

[Applause]

[Music]

wow was that random corner there

thank you

I need to remember the tracks now

because I less visibility

trying to eat some grass to Mill some

dirt

ah oh yeah okay

it is the same package

if you don't drink it you just have to

yeah there's a balance

because I have to pull it out of your

head no

that is

smelling funny and I can't drink

champagne well first of I don't drink

alcoholic drinks

and the second is I've got to drink and

drive that would be crazy

because I have I have another face today

it looks it's like an endurance

competition

how about that

that's how you get in first position

okay

and now I got the hotline comments

this is so much fun

let's catch up with this first time

okay

so

here's the water

in the forest

the forest which is just

a billboard

and that is a kind of important texture

technique

I don't remember if it was the type that

always turns towards you what the fact

that doesn't

foreign

[Music]

there's one technique that only rotates

like

it doesn't so if you look at it from top

or bottom it can it it won't change

angle

due to that it's only going to change

iron as you rotate around it and the

other technique that also angles up and

down as you okay up and down

let's make turns for everything

okay

happy that you beat that race finally

sorry I haven't been chatting I've been

having issue with the chat where it

won't let me type oh

yeah I've had issues with that

they removed it for 40 reasons I don't

know why it's there for night races when

it's basically black

and of course it's there for the amazing

but foggy races is gone

I don't know why

I would imagine having fog you would

require less

deployments because

[ __ ]

[ __ ] things up it this is the draw

distance meaning you have to draw heads

and therefore you should be able to tell

a revenue without issue because we're

the mirror is the second camera

thickness takes up for this one

[Applause]

but I didn't know

for some reason apparently takes up more

questions

what

ah this is going great

[Applause]

[Applause]

what else is that the encourages

but it still doesn't drop frames I don't

know

thanks

yeah if

this streaming thing becomes Sesame

I'm actually surprised by how

no

that's become a progressive a short time

wow flying cars

foreign

[Music]

all right

I didn't lose much or not

well it's the same thing in the next

stories again

oh that participate

barely touched it

uh where

I've got them dig into the exact code

but I've looked into the

data for the cars and experimented with

it

so for the play cars those are Sim they

are simulating the acceleration gearing

and stuff like that one for the computer

players they have three

calculated values thus it doesn't seem

late and Instagram that is free

calculator

turning on the side of the road and it

doesn't

yeah

okay finally yeah okay stop if I get

stuck inside

[Applause]

just like

I found out so

that game doesn't take and it's raining

or snowing in that other racing game

the road becomes slippery

that's especially when it's snowing

computer things

I guess

from the situation is too much making it

a bigger challenge to raise against

computers okay

doesn't affect them

[Applause]

they drive because

they drive like it doesn't affect them

because it doesn't

okay

no it's a slippery

Focus restart

now I guess back to the menu

three race

one more try

took about an hour to complete the first

track so I guess it will take another

hour for this stretch

they'll complete complete China Within

within this stream

okay people find it interesting

entertainment why not

he can do it that day that's the

motivation yeah

I can do that there's probably people

are trying to restart I mean you're

starting to move not just that he uh

instead of trans

yep someone is upside down

[Music]

thank you

[Applause]

I don't see anything

[Music]

now get out of the way

[Applause]

[Applause]

case

[Music]

study

I could say that Americans game

I think it is easier

[Applause]

he is really small again it's too hard

we must make it easy for her North

American hangers

what is the same track so I can say

something

[Applause]

this is

there it is

[Music]

[Music]

amazing oh someone crashed

now I guess they're gonna Crush

a little bit

let's grab the card against him nowhere

always sleeping up there

but it's not always having this kit

let me get out of the way I'm trying to

chase them I'll find the kids into the

first position

all right you're also trying to do that

um but please don't

[Music]

come on

oh God don't get stuck insane

[Music]

[Applause]

oh that was okay they touched the bacon

has came to start

all right

[Applause]

it's too late now because

it's my only chance

foreign

[Applause]

[Music]

[Applause]

still struggling with the chat

yeah let's see the same lab record

foreign

[Music]

I'm not too far from winning this race

so if I just

try one more time

one more time

I should be able to you can do

okay you can do it thanks to me

oh yeah now get out of the way

just get out the way already I'm trying

to drive here

wow

tonight

I'm the one supposed to get in the first

place otherwise we're stuck in this

something

is

in this endless loop of the same race

over and over again

you must let me win no

[Music]

no it's like Rami inside San Antonio

people are trying on lining each other

falling into water I guess that sounds

like some examples

foreign

[Music]

which location in the United States

China became

and what did they do with this Chinese

wall

did they be capturing to some other kind

of one

if they are not alone

big one

performances

[Music]

I've never been in the United States of

myself

I've never left

[Music]

so that's my extensive training

[Music]

on the track

like one week almost big enough

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

stunning perpendicular

[Applause]

[Applause]

time

[Applause]

and I was sleeping off with the hair of

our location I keep forgetting about

that corner

kind of because I don't see it

but I need to remove it but I keep

looking

terrible

hey everyone

[Applause]

even more terrible driving

okay I can't win if I drive this term

I need to pay more attention to where

that's

important corner is

[Music]

supposed to not seeing and then it's

basically immunity right after

everything okay I still sleeping

[Applause]

foreign

okay

I hate how liked your car seems to be

since other cars can just push you

around without any fights by yours I

think I cannot take their cars today

is but yeah because our car seems to be

very nice thing yeah

that my car seems to be nicer than that

the differences for different

it does remind me of a game I don't

remember which this is a PlayStation 2

game

and it's an open world game in a city

it's not GK that's as far as I know uh

I think it's takes place in London

anyway

in that game it's using

a different

uh

it's basically the same it simulates

your car but it does not simulate the

computer car so the computer are the

regardless of which we call the

computerized it behaves exactly the same

regardless

but if you're driving I'm big and heavy

vehicle

it does terrible breaking distance but

the computer that is driving the exact

same vehicle has the exact same brake

distance as any vehicle

it's terrible at that

they hit you it's been out of control

you hit them

no that's basically how it works

[Applause]

[Music]

or if it does be enough to control it

blocks my path so

just that thing but in that case it

wasn't a problem but it seems like

any kind of someone

in the tunnels so

or I drive her blend not in this

controller all right but that's on me

[Applause]

going on

[Applause]

[Music]

okay

[Music]

[Applause]

and after that one is sharp corner comes

and it's just cruise by

and then I drive off the routes

of course ID

my specialty yeah I guess my biggest

strike is then that just keep thing on

the track

[Applause]

foreign

[Applause]

[Music]

bother about

[Applause]

don't break in the middle of a road what

are you doing

[Applause]

then I should remember the corner after

this tunnel

foreign

[Music]

of course

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

one more decimal

saved me a bit more often okay

I don't know

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

nice try

[Music]

yeah

just randomly Falls

[Music]

[Music]

[Applause]

other community seems too much so much

easier to get

in the past not this one

this one speeds away

thank you

very sour

here we can see oh it was very selected

like this

I don't know which one of the trash it I

understand it seems a bit random

I I was hoping to see like

the lap times of all the cars

see how many got a dnf

I guess that's only for a championship

but

but I'll continue I won't give up that

easily

I've only spent half an hour on this

track

behind it

self

all right

compliments

[Applause]

but I'm I'm really glad we are exactly

with my voice

[Applause]

it's beautiful and

it makes me more confident

oh someone's eyes

[Music]

[Music]

okay

I should be able to do this

lovely advice do you want my voice

should you treat it

[Music]

sometimes I wish that was an option as

some people tell people don't like their

voice and

I like the voice

and sometimes I just wish I could train

me

[Applause]

new lap record

s

[Music]

good

and I have to say that

into the cross

and into the fence

but

my computer is very expensive crashes

but I have 100 people meet now

come on

stopped in the lead I was finally delete

and then I touch the grass these

controls sleeps across the hundreds fall

into the water

such this life

oh I see the lady right

and then my stuff on that corner looks

like Achilles

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

yes

um

um

just didn't hold it

well when I I can't stand the track that

was actually

all right come on

come on

we had a computer player so I definitely

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Applause]

[Applause]

[Music]

foreign

[Applause]

[Music]

[Music]

it was a heavy car

cannot knock the car

I'm sorry

he's definitely been by

very

what did you fall on your keyboard or

something

well it's using control and of course I

lose control

and that's that's just

[Applause]

[Music]

[Music]

[Applause]

that was something

okay I got a client site which is the

second position

it's great because I have a car in the

first Precision site

and as soon as I pass that car I get to

see how much I have to

become unlimited

too fast then

friends

I might actually do anything to catch it

thank you

yeah I do have to basically

less careful

okay

and let's continue

[Music]

and that's

cursing the thing inside so all right

record

keep getting eaten by

Cherry Bitties I still don't know what

that means

we have to explain yourself

what are the descriptive messages you

write

[Music]

let this time count

[Applause]

this is the time

if I can't beat this uh until the end of

the screen should I chase it is

[Applause]

I don't know I'm here to have fun

I mean it is from The Challenge but you

can I can try to produce something after

that

reviews

wow nice

but of course even though I made like a

perfect 360 spin and you could start

actually immediately the blue car was

somehow able to reverse and excavate and

still

recover better than I mean

how about that

Cherry PDS

from Greek mythology that swallows a lot

of water creating main storms

male drums

male straps consumes anything that

happens to get caught

hi hello wolf welcome back

to

amazing here I don't remember if you

someone played this last week

but in this racing game today

and welcome

you know what yeah sometimes I mess up

and sometimes I play really well it's

kind of random

[Applause]

I'm old

enough

I love the news about racing games in

fact inside they gives me nostalgic

vibes

foreign

I wonder if I can expect songs from the

games

[Applause]

okay

okay I'm doing terribly now I don't mind

that I know something else

music is kind of quite interesting even

though the music system is my experience

[Music]

and then actually

what do you call it I was gonna say

native music and testing

would be a correct term music made for

the game

rather than music like pre-existing

music

that's definitely

it was a complete accident

I did not have to do wait that's

something right I did not have anything

to deal with you to want to be for

example

[Music]

of course

Christmas

say what happened to the paper yeah

came in by that driver not paying

attention to the water

kind of like how I drive

thank you

100 meters

let's go

there's this

there's the card

what

I had nothing to do with that either

kind of the correct size at least it was

push

into the forest

and of course as soon as it takes the

lead I sleep down into the water

isn't that typical me

[Music]

now we have turned back time

and the blue car is back

oh I got stuck on nothing okay this song

is sorry let's switch to the next song

life in mind

I don't know these songs but I don't

know what they're expecting

I don't think they are CD music

so I don't think you can just rip them

under this correctly

[Applause]

good cast Revenge the cliff have a solid

in the morning

is it by punishment

because

oh

thank you

yeah I haven't lost already I want to

see what's going to happen

[Music]

um

[Music]

well

that was at 262. the gift card is

actually gone

for once I never thought

[Music]

gift card

[Music]

magenta cards

I'll not Escape

[Music]

I'm a fifth place I usually second place

at this part hey

what do you think you're doing

[Music]

I have nothing to catch me after them

okay if I'm that far behind

hey Jacob

something something

[Music]

[Applause]

well

that you can't give away

so I don't have anything against your

car it's just getting away all the time

maybe if the blue car didn't get in the

way and it wouldn't be an engine

I'm working there's nothing important to

believe her

Wi-Fi

oh

okay I'm inside this is

[Music]

foreign

that's just another way

getting further ahead

[Music]

[Applause]

should I make this can I do this

[Music]

do you have meters now like

[Music]

just like turn it off turn off

nice

how about that it's bouncing around

[Music]

[Music]

nothing possible

[Music]

oh come on

that's that's my attempt you're not

getting it but

I don't know how to read punishment

if you wrote something in German

y Hungarian

[Music]

any Spanish

in that case

[Music]

[Applause]

[Applause]

Spanish hospitality

oh

trees

[Music]

I don't know if they remove all the

trees

[Applause]

[Music]

thank you

and then there's this corner I keep

forgetting

[Applause]

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

and I get exactly seven seconds

the left behind but I was plus seven

seconds

record

[Music]

s

it's seven seconds behind

.com

now I can't

China

[Music]

keep forgetting about that corner

is that who is first yeah in first

position I always the same way that's

fine

[Music]

some of these like the white then you

might just comments fancy challenge but

I usually

[Applause]

[Music]

span else I guess that's something

they got a lot of messages quick read

I see the water is greatest enemy it

stays definitely is I can't even see it

in the game

can't even see the red car now that's

the problem

that that's my exact that is my

excitement I can't even see the car

inside position

so

I am able to get some vice president but

yeah

okay I think stuck on the edge of the

road

that's also one of my specialties

back on the side of the track

I shouldn't probably sometimes it's too

far to the right meaning that the corner

is sharp sharpening needs to be when you

got the items to fall into the water I

should multiply it to the left and make

the corner vegan so I can take it as a

high passive speed

but that's the most excited to the words

okay you know what is scary

to me avoiding water causes me to fall

into the water

thank you

and

yeah that's why I must be time from this

record and nothing else

enough things to do with the car Hector

excuse my weird English

you can remind me of something

trying to focus on the game

yeah

it seems like if I cannot catch up with

the car in the first lap

[Music]

40 seconds

yeah way too far to drive

I mean I have to take this water out of

time

[Music]

[Music]

I will get to do those in a moment

[Music]

because

I'm catching up and catching up

[Music]

yeah you need the car you see the car

kitten

it sounds it wasn't scream for like two

seconds

are there it is again

like a few seconds

and then I messed up those corners

but when you take something I saw a card

it's hiding in the park

switch the card never trust

is

[Applause]

no and of course the car itself didn't

fall into water either

[Music]

okay what what were we talking about

it's coming out on the race again for

the computer sheets it's mostly for

saving performance

but they don't do accurate simulations

on the computers

but but yeah they also want that vision

difficulty because they can't make a

good computer AI

that car is cheating they're probably

not even in race they probably went home

but in that case I should be easily win

that race

I love rubber banding and racing games

the game I think

around the building it is uh and it was

big when they have the boost or any game

with the Boost if you can earn boost as

you're driving and there's rubber

banding there's no point of using boost

because if you use boost all the

computer plays will go faster so you're

just wasting a boost

but you can plus using boost makes it

harder to drive

but when you can use the Boost is closer

to the end of the race before the rubber

banding can start having an effect

something like that because I assume

they've

the further ahead you get the faster

they completely placed right

but they cannot benefit from that if

you're doing it at the end of the race

at least that's how I figure it so it's

better to save your bows to the end of

race and not using during race

anyway

and earlier that red color was on screen

then just disappeared in Pokemon barely

cut up two together it's about much much

faster

regular space

I mean I suck at racing okay

I shouldn't really even be able to catch

up with it in the first case because in

a hard drive

Lyrica went home

I see it so far in this case it's a

cheat

and more polish

you're awesome I was actually okay past

it I was yeah let me get something to

drink it was the same like a minute

I need

foreign

time to get banned

be bad get bad

I'm being good

I gotta say a 30 words

and mud

hey what are you doing

[Music]

[Applause]

nice

that's the problem okay

seek

or a smooth ticket

if you want to see except something is

starting to a general Darkness

okay okay

bad position

big white cars ahead

trying to disappear into the Frog

sound second position

close to that car

and as in a corner of the car I didn't

wait

what happened I'm in the first position

okay

careful now quantum

okay

I think the red car

is qualified for some reason I had no

idea I don't know where the red car went

I think the driver gave up they want

them

behind me

that's where I had nothing to do with

that time

traveling

ah it seemed like a German

yeah ladies and German has a lot of

[Music]

no worries other Schnell and smell

because it means in a completely

different words

[Music]

learn it remember

in German is snap in Swedish

Mal in Swedish is

for some reason the word Nitric

yeah appeared in my head but

that's the current condition of this

track if I'm not mistaken

[Music]

then we

what is that the chicken

please remind me

[Music]

anyway the Swedish word that is

basically being nice and kind

opposite in China

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

yeah

that's the current condition of the

church

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

my Germans

very bad

[Music]

I need to be careful around this corner

and there we go no more water hazards

I just had to hurry to go

okay

[Applause]

[Music]

yep that happened

thank you

I messed up

at the end of drinks

quite further possible investigation so

I already

red car disappeared from the race for no

reason at all and I had nothing to do

with it

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

I don't know there's so much about

different languages

well

that's completely mindful but I crashed

I I got too much grass on the car

[Applause]

even though a real car wouldn't like

flying into space like that but that's

the physics thing

this game

awesome takes looks more in blue this

time and last time maybe you change the

color

carry this space

definitely

the car was very high in the air

for anything along upside down

anyway

[Music]

this time

there's the red car

but what happened last time

the red car is still in the race oh no

oh yeah

you get to leave this time

I just need to keep the first position

without doing his face is fine

I don't want to fly

I'm keeping the link currently so it

just went so far

I remember this corner

a second

that and the best eyes didn't embrace

and also speaking of the rubber banding

scene

and that couldn't be enough tickets and

it shouldn't affect the red car as long

as I'm behind it and I'm starting to

catch up again

because the rubber manager should only

apply

iframe

in his life is actually

a benefit

rubber band shouldn't make the car

harder as long as I'm behind

but I'm trying to sing

oh that was a bad landing

and also

it doesn't have a much rapid families in

this game and easy to test because

I want to do this thing again

now I'm doing that thing again by

driving off the ground traffic on the

cars outside your head

[Applause]

yeah basically a race when you

see it right as

best it can and try to win the race and

check what time to complete your skin

preferably stop stop at the Finish Line

I'd like to check what's the leading

cars times

and then you do a second race where you

don't move from the stock

and then check

check me first time again and see if

it's significant kids now

because it can be some random elements

involved especially if you touch the

cars like this

you should definitely

I do multiple races

[Applause]

there we go no more trashing now

[Applause]

I need to remember these corners

so I'm getting pushed

there we go I remember it

now

I need to it's going to go without

crashing and there we go I won

when that is smooth

let's throw some cat wraps at the red

car what's that

troops

that should be indicated that should be

in a game

you did it yes I did it

it only took me

longer that took like one hour 20

minutes but I did it

but this time that me should mean that

it's a sad track I do have a new car

but only one liquor

406 Coupe that's

[Music]

take that Lucy red car

the red car at least got to stay on the

track

and with the search Chinese race

oh no it's night

don't do this stress the better

or both nice

memories

[Music]

don't stop in the truck and drive again

and this time the track should be a

different variant

so it's the first track or like format

on the track that's a variance

that's what it's called

Peugeot something like that that Peugeot

his friends

and in Swedish we just call it it's like

it's an approximation we're using

Swedish sounds

even though we could say for sure as

well but that doesn't really sound

Swedish it sounds

this

[Music]

it's an approximation using Swedish

sounds and making it sound like a

Swedish word

okay you can stand and technique

challenge

I don't mind

[Music]

I have a car

[Applause]

a car that is 100 meters

okay

and that's that

he's facing straight down into the road

and you can't see anything because

that's perfectly touching them

while you see the lights doesn't shine

the closest to the car it's amazing and

therefore on the road is if you have

something in that position

as

one and you're not going to see anything

else because it's in the black sand

if that's perfectly logical

where is the cars this car is also gone

this is a it's over a red car again it's

probably haven't changed

has been the red car in the first race

and the second place the bus with the

red car in the surface

[Music]

I guess this is meant to simulate

the high bees

definitely they shine no City car as

well

because headlines don't really have much

I mean

no I'm upside down at the moment

no hiding this is this is supposed to be

the high beams

mm-hmm

wait I can have my clothes out

I guess I get like one polygon extra in

distance I can't do this

as well I guess it didn't

yeah I should probably expect you in the

Cars one

hey

let's let's do that yeah

you might as well just be trying it

doesn't happen I can't do this instead

and

I really want something in between those

two settings

I want to see the extra distance it

actually since you gain from losing the

very mirrors to the car

I gave it a try but

I haven't seen it yeah

oh hello cars

spinning around

but it still feels like I'm seeing less

in these things

probably because apparently likes these

clothes up kind of makes me focus more

on the transport but they heard the card

in the second position

I think there's two red cars

this might be the second red card

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

these games are huge

that game is available for PlayStation

one as well but I'm going to do the PC

version instead because

practice why do I get stuck at the side

of the road to this huge part of

polygons

inside of her on

yeah that's the problem with elderly

named the polygons on the volition mesh

the visual mesh and the Collision mesh

must be the same capacity to have people

okay

[Music]

good thing you don't qualify it was

amazing

I think it's got plastic uh

don't find me

is driving on top of you

roofs

[Applause]

I can't remember what's gone

in Swedish we have the same word for

roof and smooth because why you have two

different words it's always from complex

[Applause]

what English has the same word or

something that is hard which is

difficult

and something that is hard to ask in

quite solid

then again not soft

I'm not soft and something not too easy

which are two completely different

concepts but it's the same words

although you could argue that everything

seems I think it's kind of the same

thing which goes architecture

[Music]

I guess okay how far ahead is that do

you enemies

let's see

the same Venom

expected

you let emptiness but I'm catching of

them

and it's as far as I can see it's the

red car

because of course it's the red car it's

always the red card except for that one

time it was a blue car but that never

happened

last time

still see the red car as he's small

glimpse above it needs ketchup

thank you I'm being more off the side of

it than on the Earth

and one section two

I can help foreign once

[Music]

oh no

keep forgetting with Scottish

[Applause]

in that corner

oh Sam was it 70 seconds

from there

okay I was trying to do something there

today

and I guess I got punished for it

[Applause]

got a bit of liftoff and then the car

fell out there wait I'm supposed to

hydrate

hydrates okay

this time

will it cries out his way

get my jamster about the car and number

two years after doing

I was just in white with a silver and

the replica

yeah

it's like I have that covered yellow

wings

especially true that card

using plastic

flipping the car

more always more water

way too much walking

gets at three out of 10 too much water

anyway

[Applause]

as if that was like

if we kissed up

[Applause]

suspectful

do you want to play a monos

here we go

all right so that means that it's the

magenta and the extra red card left

devour it past them

[Applause]

there we go there they are awesome we

should shut it down I'm not sure how you

should put your Charlie down let's try

what's up

[Applause]

[Music]

I'm the first person

I wouldn't mind doing this

yeah I thought yeah if randomly switched

Among Us I think that was kind of weird

okay this this is Chris what's going on

okay all right let's start

there's a pile up of course

not again anyway

I should I want to like

if

I do want to play

with some people we can do like uh

can't wrap some people and play it looks

like I certified I don't know what that

is

anyway let's proceed

wow wow

yeah there's some crashes going on here

no one needed audit two red cars are

together

and the fake cry behind again

but which car is indeed in that place

because she

[Applause]

is

[Music]

all right

[Music]

I've never been to I-65 only IE I've

probably never been to Eisen

[Music]

[Music]

methods and numbers

huh Can you forget about this corner at

least I

keep earlier so cute

oh wait the favorite part is ahead of

the real red car

come on

tours in the leads

whoever is in the leads really really

fast

or something

[Applause]

surprise okay

person showing up for the race

in some supercar

[Applause]

without any catching up

oh it's in my gender car why is it

normal and why is it so fast

did I say it was

falling to the water

please

it's your teeth

it's like he's my duty team

drive off their hand

okay there's the first one and then

there's like this sharp corner another

one there are over the second one

because

this shot or it goes right back like

that same now I was prepared please

and I still manage to get up into the

gas what's gonna

what a terrible driver I am

that it comes amazing

anyway

[Music]

before seven seconds

it's snowing and then correctly

[Music]

it's not raining it is not sleeping

I just had to

that's nice

oh no no

even though I did that thing

[Applause]

it doesn't buy anymore

mine is the agenda one so difficult of

seven

this doesn't make any sense

and then

why wasn't magenta car so incredibly

hard to catch up with I don't get it

red car and sauce red car

even better when you remember the Among

Us mascot wears a red seed

yeah I guess the yeah

the primary Among Us characters with

they should randomize that in the game

I'd like to make it your color I guess

didn't he pass both why aren't you in

first uh I did pass both red fires but

like who's very posters

when did perfect I guess I don't know it

starts in like last position I pass it

like

early race

I don't care about it but this time

they must have replaced the engine or

something

oh hello

this time I did not question okay

now I sounded into that price

suspicious red car

s

and my car is blue

um

[Music]

I should at least try to finish these

things before it's been so nice that's

my dream

[Applause]

and then we'll see at the next place

where why are standing still in the

middle of the road

it's dangerous don't do that Maurice

especially not on my trains

issues

[Music]

I mean me too I'm not going to get cash

up when I'm trying this table

apparently I need to catch up with

everything within the first part and

then I can

watch challenging in the first place if

I if I'm like fixed position after all

of the film left

yeah let's see in that case I'm not

going to be anyways

it's the uh

if you can't find cost fallacy I should

not conference just because I wasted my

time racing

[Music]

continue wasting my time being so far

behind

[Music]

it's better to just restart instead

thank you

I'm gonna start

[Music]

there we go now I'm in second position

[Music]

and then you got deleted

can't manage to get out of the bag

[Music]

okay this is

between you and the lead car yep

[Music]

but yeah

and definitely in another racing game

for Festival

[Applause]

thank you

all right

yeah and the rest of cards are only

obstacles that's basically how it works

and don't drink once more time that is

actually a fair point you shouldn't read

comments while driving

I shouldn't have a code driver who can

come in these comments for me

they can just read them out loud

I mean there are like speech to text

wait a minute

okay

that's your speech comment

that could read comments for me which

could read the comments like they it

doesn't have to read it out loud on the

stream you can use to it out loud for me

on idea

it's dangerous you can crash yeah

I crash there so I had plans with

comment especially when it says more

comments

I do appreciate them in your comments

too

and I do prefer one non-common instead

like five short comments in that row

quicker after one after another

especially people who write a single

word per line

that's the worst

I don't like it

[Music]

[Music]

I should do that

I should modify

I'm not trying to do that it's

you are a good kitten

that's the reason

I might oh no

[Music]

[Music]

and I collided with a wall

okay I need a very start never some

services

[Music]

okay now let's do this

hello

making a fruit

can I still catch up with everything

I guess I lost the race

sometimes

it it feels kind of strange like how

I can catch up with everything in like

first half of the first lap and then

that after that everything seems to keep

the same distance half the time

and that's not how it works but it kind

of feels like it

[Applause]

[Music]

it's not styling skin okay

[Music]

let me get onto the speech without

colliding into stuff

right outside

but that's an impermanent

I just need to okay catch up and leave

it out which I see should be great

foreign

[Music]

[Applause]

everything

and yeah and me looking back at my

riding

later on burning

it's more obvious looking back at me

can you play and such

they thought after it's been saved

taking a bath again great timing by the

way

as it is possible that you have very

high screen the lane that's why

it's not good way to fix that on mobile

searching for different qualities

available because of I haven't had

unlocked yet

yeah the dip the carrying water and then

you start three Saturdays

that's amazing

[Music]

still going too fast for that corner

thank you

it's an important position is better

than six positions
