oh hello

can I abrupt in in the music there

so the game is currently starting up I

was a bit delayed on that

I love kitten nice to see you hey

I was happy to see you

soon today

uh I will like try to finish up the

remaining

of a spiral

that's by three of the

um

the no flame button uh challenge

no

yes things

and let's see

yeah I did to Sparks levels I was going

to try it then

okay

first I need something to drink

the mouse doesn't prepared

I guess that's that's my streams

hydration time

yep

so

and also

a very small change to the channel

you now have

set up points

is your voice as good thank you

it does

help me yeah

more positive

so

the kitten seems to have been subscribed

but not subscribed followed since before

that's the action what I wanted to say

um did you start off with 300 points

foreign

since I don't have any

verbs

use the power up here no

this is uh quite a hard challenge

oh yeah and I

can't go back

maybe I can go back after

defeating

okay take it

doesn't allow me now I probably have to

defeat the final boss before I'm allowed

to go back

I got some of her recently but I'm a

student okay so you start at 300 and

then you got some of course

extra if for the time you've been here

and well

the normally 10 points for every five

minutes

but then you earn

on it I need to ltft upper portion first

then he gets additional 20 for the

subscription

I don't remember what the blue is isn't

that like a shield

no it was not

oh don't move

[Music]

foreign

which I do need

I've been here back

when there was all the two followers I

can't shoot me when the game starts

that's cheating

yeah you've been one of the early ones

you don't even have to

[Music]

okay

this is going to be quite the challenge

but that's a kind of this stream

and it's going to be me struggling with

this level

and I will

struggle with it until I can do it

I didn't know what I was supposed to

title this three

I wanted to basically

make it clear that it's the basic

challenge I've already completed

but then I also

I do want to make

it's not changes

we need to figure out how to do the

SketchUp

okay I'll get into there

what opens that one

your jumps there

trying

Okay so

basically need to keep this power up

foreign

[Music]

guys

okay that's not an option

another every moment of his dreams

you're doing is such a good job

very happy I think so if I

can

no

but I certainly don't have the

experience streaming

I I believe I will

improve over time

I mean the way this power-up shoots

kinda

why he's taking shots

okay and I cleared

I basically have to rush this thing

I'm not touch it

and I cleared

next area

okay so fine

and this one oh there's another one

so

I just hope there's no spawner or

anything I don't remember

if I spread them out

okay

um

that's

and then I'm stuck there

okay I'm

seeing how much you did it I need to sit

down a lot before I enter that area

and yeah

and I quickly put this ml together

foreign

so I'm not really an artist and that's

not really an expression it's just

it's just pon pon

yeah I want like common expressions

to be

common expressions for Pon pond

so which also allows me to use

some funny emotes when I'm on audio

streams

which

running up I don't have any modes

available for myself

okay whatever

not much space here to move around

foreign

nice to see you here

you're an artist a cute artist I guess

technically since I made that one

but

so far it goes well

it's nice uh I wanted to pick that up

but that was an enemy

and that's so uh

since uh oremian as you might see you

have different colors basically every

time it's fine if you want that but you

should be able to press on your own name

and then edit

oh yeah but it or can you just press on

the

I think it's like a to the left of the

chat like the star and then at the

bottom you can basically choose one of

the

available free colors to use whichever

you think Suits You

[Music]

if you want to stick with one color

a bit easier to choose color but

no problems

should we get the spawner

there you go

I wish I could hold multiple power-ups

or if the camp gets safe and my power up

for the checkpoints

or if this level I don't know

allowed me to backtrack I could pick up

an old power up again

that was a completeness

okay now here

wasting one hit point there uh it's not

a waste

I'm saving shot okay actually

so I made through that part

and so

and I have 100 shots left

just hope it's enough to

or you know get a refill

it managed to spawn one before I could

destroy it

please no more spawners

no it is a spider egg

now there's a blue Power

I don't want blue proverbs

I don't even remember what about me

I need help

that means I have destroyed up on the

floor

I'm gonna cut this far before

it has been destroyed

no

if I have less than nine shots I can't

pick up the power

and I assume I'm going to go down here

to my green one what's the green one

I love to look that up

it's probably a sparkle here

oh apparently not

I think my color changed now yeah now

you're purple and you should appear

purple in the chat as well it's got the

dark purple

I haven't really made

um

adjustments for how dark it takes

because yeah they are the color because

the color shouldn't appear

but I've done some so if you

sell the carrots is the points you have

perhaps doesn't belongings and then you

can currently I don't like split me

and I'm pretty sure it's supposed to be

purple it's kind of a bluish purple

yeah on screens actually appears more

blue but in the chat it appears more

purple

interesting

because I wanted to

uh

because I don't remember me I don't know

if this comes it's cheating

they can

no I cannot find the information so I

guess

this is a I guess

I guess you don't need a highlighted

message

it's probably more a value well

we get chats

let's start

I don't have a power up nowhere no one

in that case

oh the green one is the green one is the

one I want yeah

I just remember that green one gives the

yellow power

scared

no

wait why aren't they following me

elephants like they're spun ahead yep

but not messed up

no

I did it

foreign

and the color is based on your chosen

color so in case of Bohemian would use

the highlighted it should show up in

that case you might be able to detect if

you believe are grapple

yeah spin those Channel points it's not

like you cannot buy or sell Channel

points which I think is the intended

intentional

so you can't

okay it's this this feels like a strange

room

no there's a spa here

foreign

one but I can take health

yeah it's bus time

no

how am I supposed to feed it now

that's health health

just guess I can try that

I can possibly do that

hopefully I don't need to defeat that

all this morning

wow

that was an easy blast

I'm surprised that actually worked

yeah

of course I'm missing gems at five

oh you're back

now it's in the corner

I did it I completed the land

kind of

kind of like uh

oh oh thank you

I remember for this subscription

would be for subscribing I think I would

say is raise it

when I saw that giant stingray

won't let you watch

and also it works there tier one or one

wait it doesn't say who it was

um

it should say it should say order me a

subscribe tomorrow

tier one for one month

but yeah this means that you that you

can use this very

awkward and exclusive emote

I will lay

uh

I would have probably I haven't gotten

the exact definition for one I've heard

some say that I need to do 100 streams

and then

pay attention

like you thank you

okay uh this means that I now can go to

agent night's lab which I have one

percent

awkward

she's kinda

it's just looking awkwardly

Timmy thackered

but I will try to see if I can

have it made

it's hard to see if you got the extra

Health on this orb as far as I know you

should be able to

wait a minute okay I can't do that

but how am I supposed to get through

here

unless I get a checkpoint there in that

case I have any place to start from I

guess

what happened

like uh upon holding a heart that one

because I don't see any other thing I

could use in this area

yeah that is what that's kind of jump I

want but it only works half the time

oh I guess I can these shots are

stronger

I'm pretty sure they cannot destroy this

but this

can I pass through it in the wrong way

no

how am I supposed to go around that

where where is

yeah I think I need to use the

I just did I said was just jumping Yoshi

confirmed that okay now this box has

this extract now on this party

where business got Spark

yeah that cannot be a violence

there you go

oh they can shoot through the one

but what

I was almost thing almost so close

okay but now I kind of have it done down

I cannot

so I cannot jump immediately as soon as

it has water but I cannot wait for too

long because then

insta kill

okay

I mean I can use a bomb on that one

apparently I can't if i

it is possible to use a bomb on that one

I just

I assume that's how she would say

[ __ ] me if I'm wrong

welcome

to this dream

I'm currently trying to get some extra

Health yet yeah

that's good

good

there are anticipated where it will be

there we go finally

I've done I've not noticed but the

the bomb countries in the middle

so yeah

this will be a bombers only run with

agent line

which requires you because this

because this is uh you know flame button

run and this means that the hair can

only use bombs if raging nine

but it also means that to even be able

to get to the bombs it requires me to

jump in the water four times as far as I

know

I don't think you can do it in three

times

but to be able to get can do that

you must first do three levels of sparks

without with only power ups and no

regular shifting

yeah can I do this

maybe that should have counted

it's kind of like the regular items I

anticipate why they will be

no

I mean I could

I guess collect health

and then

come back

I get a checkpoint

forget the egg I will get a checkpoint

yes thank you for standing still

because I need to get Professor here

this is quite interesting

my sequence breaking the level

they have the pineapple didn't drop

anything

yeah okay so I can use bombs on them

that's good so I need to defeat all six

so I can get a checkpoint see if I fail

the water jump

uh I just need to be better at hitting

them I can retry it

instead of trying to get those to get

the bombs again and

get Full House and

I'll say I should pick out before

and set the bombs before I go in here

and maybe I did that last time it's just

that

yeah can you okay can I own it so it's

that far

semi-faction you'll be able to get

everyone

because I have someone being all the way

out there I don't know if they get

closer

I'm gonna do

Tony for a short one

for our specific parts

yes sir

in that case let's see if I can get

that one in particular

by spamming the Box

yep it worked

okay and in that case I know how to get

them

very Stood Still

together

Full House

and

now to the more tedious part

I need to anticipate where they will be

okay there

and then I just have to wait hopefully

okay it doesn't seem to have a long path

my timing

here we go

three down three yeah

yeah that

I take that

in the rhinox going in the same

going the same path back and forth

of course

there you go

four

done two together

all right I didn't check

this

yeah I don't think that's close enough

to actually hit

I only checked one of them

yeah I don't think I can get this one

unless I find another place to stand up

it's like a puzzle that might not have a

solution

work

after getting four of them I might

actually not be able to get one of the

last one

yeah I'm gonna be able to get that one

either

am I allowed to shoot them

I guess I'll just have to try to get

back to the main island again

would be a lot of jumping back and forth

I'll just have to do it

oh

well I got over that was the primary

objective so

uh onto it so

a concert

thank you

yeah I think that was odd

do I have

now I have to take this one out

how did that not count

I'm wasted on a pump wait yeah I've

taken everything out now

and are you not happy

okay that this is weird

why isn't this working it doesn't matter

how am I supposed to progress the level

now

yeah I

don't know what's wrong at the moment

if someone

wait a minute why are these dead hair

why is there still Collision here

oh it's the tricky that one

oh

so using bombs on these just actually

not trickier

they were

destroyed

yep that's that's the issue

that wasn't that was interesting

one

I must be

wait

yeah no I don't have any bumps no more

and no house to get more bombs

and I only chance if they yeah they have

some response

but I don't have anything to just the

right way

yeah

yeah I don't know this this level is a

bit hard to do without

okay I have one more idea

no wait that doesn't give me helps back

okay next idea

weird heavy

that it is where the pumps destroys

those things but okay

yes as I expected

would have brought me back there

meaning that I can go and get the bombs

again

it was a fail jump but I guess it was a

success

no

not stopping

so here we go oh extra Health extra Life

Time

oh yeah I need to pick up bombs inside

the place

it is working I just have to waste some

lives but it is working

and do that in one with jump

foreign

box wasn't destroyed either

okay I have some so now I know those

rules

yeah I can do this I can do this

now I know the rules

I know the rooms

I say as I fail

edition only require seven bombs to

complete that and I should hopefully get

a checkpoint if I don't I don't know

what to do

yeah she has put them there

I don't know if you can damage him

I mean that should be something I should

check do you take damage from your own

bombs

no okay okay it's good to know

right back do you have to go for the

response

I can't see it responding

I'm about to look away

yeah I have to look away

what is that that case I can get up to

it is because that way it should stop

in that case it will stop

um yeah can you can you not move thank

you

I thought they were supposed to stand

still when you approach them

I need to can anyone too respond

yes not far enough

palette for a chicken

that seems like a good distance

okay stand still

so it doesn't sit still

you write that as it just stood still

looking at me while I'm holding a bomb

is that full health

full stuck up on bombs

I need more bombs tennis

if I took damage there

I could waste bombs on trying to get

that one but I cannot

this

I need them to kind of react at the same

time

like this

not stressful

very very short timer wait I have a

solution I can I can can I cheat

using the rules of the game

so another cheat code or anything like

that

or mods or anything

using the rules given by the game

that's basically what I'm doing now

just no flame button that's there only

self

um something something rude

X

three

yeah

so

let's continue

my punishment for like now it stands

still that's what I wanted you to do

this is still for quite a lot

foreign

why is it jumping backwards

okay now jumping forward

every tense

egg thing bother you destroy I'm not

sure how this is foundered but

can you

pay attention to me you get an extra

life

so that should be seven

self-imposed imposed yeah

and what's the word I was looking for

thank you

so yeah

using others of the game with the

exception of the self-imposed challenge

of not using the flame button which is

the

shift button for agent line they are

going to eat that that was another new

thing

is the game about to break

so

since as I demonstrate here

these people people want to shoot me but

if I do these

they will no longer shoot me even though

I'm standing in the same position

so that is my trick

so yeah this works star Kenya still

needs

and then

my question is can I shoot them each

other

wow

what was that

what what

should I gotten rid of them and not mess

around

okay

that's

okay so they can shoot each other

kill each other

I I jumped

okay so they can't take out each other

good to know

well in that case

that's that's that's the what I have to

do I guess because I probably need to

conserve the bombs

Plus

because I won't be able to get back to

pick up more bumps that's the issue

so I can only pick up as many bombs as I

need

so and then when I destroy the second I

should get an extra health and full

extra life and full health

I don't need to destroy one of them even

though I found a progress

process let's get rid of normal

quickcast it doesn't know why it's

jumping backwards

and that's the extra life yes

I've lost so many lives on this

okay so so far so good you sure can't

jump high out of the water

I cannot jump over I'm shooting

oh yeah wait I can do this

okay there we go

I forgot I forgot to panic button

I don't see it being like a

right button but sure

okay

there we go

will he move yes thank you

yeah I do know about the other door

she's

it's going to be quite annoying

oh that one is a good position

okay

I say hi can you guys get affiliate

thank you viola

I am quite happy and I'm just about

expressing my happiness

uh oh this this one must achieved

good night

so

um yeah next step is to get the

honey bunny

okay I'm

[Music]

I'm messing up I

wait didn't I get a checkpoint

uh

I wasn't too careful because I have I

didn't pay attention to relax the

checkpoint

yeah

yeah China points now you can

have fun fun wear a different outfit I

guess

dancing bad

and chocolate

yep

that means I need to take out

four of these

and why is there only one

it's so tedious to walk back and forth

two

and I put together that

carrot icon myself

rather quickly

I mean it's good enough it does its job

okay didn't work

all right back basically after almost

walk into what

what what's going on now

it it yeah okay it's good enough

how many times father can respond or

something

because if this thing doesn't respond

please like invisible or something

break the ball of the freezer butterfly

inside so that work can eat it

oh

you mean like the

unless that thing is callable

yeah

because I don't know the technical terms

for those things

then why doesn't it respond why is it

gone

I cannot make it back without it

well I guess I'll

no it's not going to work

since it's like a failure anyway

that was a double fish yet

okay I have no idea why it refused to

respawn so

I had no other choice than to die

no one more try I don't know how to do

with these things I ring sneaky living

whatever they are called

scientific vessel for liquids

that's what they're called

I think it's back

vanilla counts I I it took it out three

times

make it stop

okay

thank you finally

that that would be four

last okay

yeah I think I've heard

about that before

that's just the Swedish word for bottle

Mr Wrangler

bottle of anything

lasca

yeah we add another letter probably

related

what type of emails do you plan to add

well

I guess the yeah I do take suggestions

and

so but

I guess I'll just

do it

basically the ones other usually have

which is

B

something like

yeah okay like this I guess

I think that's uh quite common

probably what people are looking for

but if you have suggestions I'm open

I think the Triangular ones are

Irvine

okay what's what's the what

country does the person come from

it's like a German added event

doesn't matter

it's like it's like

English

and Meyer

I I went my

cute

oops I missed out

I'm not going to get over here

foreign

one of the Champions didn't work I

jumped too early I guess

the these jumps are quite

tricky

that's it

but I said a lot of things so

I mean if it's if

I mean yeah if you go to pronounce like

it

yeah in English

but I mean I mean

I come from a city I call Stockholm but

that's like the Swedish pronunciation

but that's what I'm used to

and I do like to try to pronounce

people's names like they should be

pronounced

like your cat question

and the question is returned you're just

gonna block my view of the screen but I

guess you just have to

better have her lay down on your lap or

something

so she doesn't block your yeah I mean

there's nothing to see I know I am just

feeling failing at this challenge anyway

the remaining part of the

is is it refusing to spawn again come on

what is this

mainly now

I mean I'm kind of breaking the game

anyway but

okay I

just thought I had something there

yeah I'm not going to get back with this

house

all right I don't I don't get this game

sometimes

but yeah maybe I should

well when I can't

get back at least I can pick up those

gems now I have I have quite a lot of

gems without even defeating the first

they can't figure out

using them because these analysis

responding landscape I'm not really

trying to chase the level that sets the

scene

this is like the only way I can do the

level

and I was so close last time

and I just had to

fool around and paint

I need to stop fooling around so I can

actually do this

thank you Full House

stop now to not fool around

let's say as I have a slip down into the

water

oh so far so good

okay

so they are a total of

so I need one more bump

right

s okay stunning

okay

not the easiest to

the other width

yeah if he was left-handed it would have

worked

but there we go

although I should have made the other

one shoot

foreign

wait why are you

wait wait what's going on

oh

of course

okay I'm done Professor ah I am done

hey can I get a checkpoint please

I got a checkpoint

are you gonna shoot me

a picture take the long time

ah he took

okay okay I cannot leave the platform I

took all my bombs so this is another

part where I have to use

foreign

because

there is no other way for me to do this

the only exception to this challenge

the game is forcing me to use the flame

button

if you're going to shopping again

thank you

and last one

good shot

thank you checkpoint please thank you

which means that I now

because I can pick up these two more

bumps

I need bumps jump in the water from the

ground

no wait a minute I'm not going to pay

him

oh yeah

I don't think I may will be able to do

this part

yeah yes

okay how long do you flash wash

okay six Birds I can take out six birds

with ten bombs that's no problem

and if I don't get a checkpoint this

challenge will be impossible

but we'll see we'll see how it goes this

is quite interesting

that's kind of partly why I did this

challenge because it is quite

interesting to see see how

far I can take this I guess

and the birds are in there so I'm almost

at this place

walk all the way over here

I've never made sure to walk

far back as well then yeah it does

respond

and then

another one

also I haven't really paid attention but

but it has the

rhinoc counter on top of the bird County

going both at the same time

both happen to be six

I don't know is it doing this again

it is doing this again

why

tell me what

[Music]

yeah I cannot get over there

it's too far

if they're only were two flasks there

it would have made it so much more

convenient but

of course not

that was a weird

effect

yeah as soon as I get the last

different ways

to

get the gate open

I need nothing but the heart

my heart aches for these

non-spawning masks

is it does it hurt anything to do with

with position I kill it

but if I kill it too close to this area

it doesn't respond because its depth

location was too close or something

different you're more over here

then it stops here

she still feels like a

killed it at the application before

maybe I'm not allowed looking at that

location

maybe it's very picky

and it's back

[Music]

that it works

and then the final one

yeah the final one

is it the second time it does this

sound continue practice my attempt of

getting across because

even though I don't believe that's

possible

oh

thank you the box butter for following

yeah I cannot get this across by

just one jump

so now I only have one jump left and I

cannot get across there and I don't see

any other way of doing this kind of

climbed them once or something

now

yeah it's so close it's so close

everybody

and the Optimus is not following yeah

that message works the subscription

machines it's message is a little bit

broken I need to look more into that

okay

should these flask displays stop not

appearing

yeah

let's stop not respawning anyway

this is such a weird challenge

it's almost like I can do that in one

show

okay I will take you out over here

and I did some

and soon I should get an extra life

putting

me full health so I don't have to do

this

I just wish there was an easy way of

doing it

no come back

I don't want to

put around with killing in a specific

position

that's just adding more time to the

setup

if only had safe States

taking type

and setup isn't really part of the

challenge

no extra knife

yeah when I take out the last one

the last one will will it be an extra

life if I'm not mistaken

open back there

it was really a waste of an extra life

because it will give me full health

regardless

let's add

what was that it stopped

all right

which puts me at Full House

a regular butterfly monosity

yeah oh well

did you like that

I don't know what happened

uh

still have 12 more chances after this

month

but why did that happen

anyway let's start with something else

so

um

I do want to

at least currently I feel like I do want

the vagina stream

one Saturday because it's from stream

doesn't mean I always do that of course

just imagine someone saying that

chickens learn yourself out or something

I cannot change the schedule in the

future there's no problem

but for now I feel like doing that

but the question is which times I should

do it because I do want to do different

times

every day

to get different people

people of different times so that chance

to

join

and

yeah

I don't know when do most people join

Sundays

like today is a Saturday

and then I usually start two hours later

on Sundays so maybe I should do the

Sunday time keep this on the time as it

is

and it doesn't respond yeah I think I

think

I think I'm getting tired of the

challenge because it's it's not working

currently you know

I I cannot broken challenge somehow I

don't know how

I don't know

why does it say I have zero when there's

only two left

I think I've broken the whole left

yeah I like the current Sunday time yeah

I think it's a good time and then I put

the same time for

so the current idea is that Saturday

Sunday I do the Sunday time

the two are related and this time

and then the

the Sunday starts at

into hours basically

whatever time that is in your time soon

I want to avoid saying specific times

because it's it's so awkward is it time

since I'm hurting everything

it's but it is 12 o'clock uh UTC on

Sundays so I put that on Saturdays as

well

yeah that's

let's go to the Sparks 11 instead

and then it's 18 on Thursday UTC

which I then can do Friday as well

so if I do

if I had to play one game

Saturday Sunday

another game Thursday third Thursday

Friday and then I can do

another game Monday Tuesday I just need

a an idea for a time I should do Monday

Tuesday

and that's like

it's three different games which I do

know

that might be

a cute amounts Maybe

okay let's see this now

power-ups only

and no regular shooting

and then Wednesday because every game is

played few days every week

there's three living games and then

Wednesday which is the final day I could

do a smaller game

which I don't really need to um

two days before

me I mean ow

my follow me I got me crash into me

I really want that one

there is a limit of Harmony to spawn

in the powerapps

that's moving on enough

what's that one

let me stop that one

it's not that one

it is that one

eagle flies and they

lay the birds

looks like it's not interested

oh

finally I can actually defend myself

here we go

oh that took a Thai food up here

what am I missing foreign

thank you

handing it over to me

yeah no idea

gem spawn so late

okay it's not that one

third one's not that one

I just opened it must be this one

this one

okay I hope there's no spot right here

doesn't seem like that

it still seems like I'm missing a key

okay there's a spot right here

again

I will watch you stream anytime that

that's good to know but this doesn't

help me much

you know seems and doesn't okay

not

scared as I hoped

I can't pick up the power up

why do I have to restart so

far back

twelve

I'm okay

yeah okay now

foreign

thank you

okay thank you for dying I'm gonna run

into that one

and you should ask yourself responding

things

just wanted to go so I can get

this battle okay

all right

got so much health

centipede

oh wow

okay this challenge is failed

I thought I was supposed to get the

checkpoint outside and also it attacks

me as soon as I spawn that's

cheating

yeah I cannot do this you can do it now

I can't do it

I don't have the powers anymore

and also

yeah that's

that's not nice

yeah

I mean like if I restart a level I could

do it in a different way

if that's what you mean

I could try

maybe two touch times loud

some

why aren't you speaking to me

is that when you exit the level there

she spoke to you

that particular one is a bit weird

so

yeah

so I basically have to run

instead of the whole level

and also despite getting the extra

health I don't have extra Health in

Islam

I don't think so

it's a normal amount of Health

[Music]

checkpoint thank you

thank you

how do I respond now

checkpoint checkpoint

okay so I need to kill those basically

before I pick up the key

I think on that when I started

no they are not where's the heart

okay

come on

I don't think all right what are your

things

wait no it's not so it's not that one

I've had the

foreign

this one

two damage as I wanted to

okay

so I want to now

basically die before I get to the boss

battle

which is in here

so I can pick up a new

we're up

taking more damage trying to shoot them

instead of just

okay that didn't get us planned

oh I need to

take that one out

okay I basically want to take out as

much as possible because when I pick up

that key

you get a checkpoint

and I don't think I have

time enough to pick that up and then Ram

the boss with it

that's also however I should pick up

maybe I actually can

okay before picking up

so I have a bit of stretchy now I just

need to prepare before I take the

checkpoint

I still don't know what point of this

gate is

it does it open when I defeat the boss

that doesn't make much sense

and

it won't help so

thank you

I don't think there's anything

interesting things

I'm just doing great though

why are you moving so strange

I guess that's all that's

in that case let me pick up the key

get that checkpoint and if I don't give

a checkpoint that would be annoying

and then

admit how am I supposed to die

I forgot about that do you think so much

for that strategy

thousand learning

point but of course I cannot die

so that's

that's mistake

unless I can use the key on this thing

still don't know what this thing is

foreign

okay so I have the idea of how I should

do this

I should not kill all the enemies so I

can die

turning like six enemies surviving in

the end

I'm gonna pick up the key

and after we have the key

so I can die

those six enemies should preferably be

in the beginning of the 11th so I don't

accidentally stumble upon them when I

pick up the butterflies

to prepare for boss battle

and then I will have these 300

mix to shoot with as well as the shield

that would probably hopefully not run

out before I can attack these but

shame I cannot used

this one I want to enable The Shield

it's so cute your persona is tough yeah

yeah glad you like it

um

now

yeah and then I destroyed it

and then I don't need these enemies

okay can I get better but

two minutes

foreign

enemies in this room

I

guess after you must spend

I don't want any enemies here because I

need this past to be clear so I can pick

up the shield

and when I'm going to do the boss battle

and then I have enemies I forgot about

this uh

I need to have these workers

and that's my video away

there we go

means being spinning

so

now

we go and die

and also if you this is mentioned

bye

yeah bye bye sequence

it also affects the life counter and it

might be a bit hard to see but on left

side where

inspired animal is yeah

as much as

with the sea

yeah yeah I guess the ears stand out

any cute pumpkin thing

normally spelled with a space which

doesn't allow spaces in his name sadly

okay

time to go

and then one against the boss

I need the butterfly to be on the right

side so I can

thank you

[Music]

do something like that

is having some kind of pattern change

version

I mean I I take that middle of the works

thing

okay now we stay

I'm gonna get one chance because I'm

getting a cheap one

here we go

I didn't even hit it

he didn't even need the power up

okay now

I didn't get any of that power because

hopefully that gate is up in the upset

if you have to find a chance

thank you for bleeding me

I yeah I had

a few taps

okay how am I supposed to open this

and I'm so confused

because I actually yeah it's the two

fives and the

the creature itself has the time oh it's

been even here that's

now I

thank you

I appreciate that

I did actually manage all four lengths

without shooting

except the tutorial you're forced to

shoot in the tutorial and I don't kept

that one

for some reason

she doesn't say it I think

remember Sparks can break open treasure

chests and using the guidebook warp you

to any level you want and that's how I'm

saying correct the first part is correct

no

break open Treasure Chest which I

basically broken up all of them anyway

broken yeah I've broken up yeah

broken open

um but the warp thing is something you

have from the start not sure if I didn't

change that

are they recorded online and then

decided that you should be able to more

people start

or are they just

so I guess I guess that's that

I'm not sure why I can't get it 20 times

from that one but

maybe it's another one of those videos I

have to shoot something for it to

trigger correctly

but what I did is something that you

could accidentally do because you might

not actually shoot every enemy you might

actually Ram them

that shouldn't be a requirement

they really need to test their games

more

like what happens

I think that I think that should be part

of the bug testing that for agent 9 who

you should be able to what happens if

you instead of having your gun you must

rely on using bumps throughout the whole

level

how will it never respond to that and

you can't even clean the first area with

bombs only because it doesn't trigger

correctly

you know

yeah I'm I think I'm basically done with

this game now

it took you almost two hours but

yeah the agent line level is too buggy

to look complete so

that's my excuse It's for not actually

trying

I mean I would continue to try but yeah

it's too buggy inside

cannot bother

so that's that so on other news

um

today's on Saturday so Saturday in a

week

I should be able to bye

I wonder if I can show this

I guess

I said this one

it doesn't work it gives a black screen

oh

I tried

so I was thinking that uh the next week

on Saturday which is the sixth of May

that's uh ponpon's birthday I've decided

605 eggs yes I have six or five eggs in

Islam

so I wanted to

yeah and I got 107.

that's what the original game did

could have changed if this game but they

decided

um

okay anyway and so on the birthday of

Grandpa is it's not really the birthday

just

yesterday I picked four Pom-Pom so

that's that's will act as my public

birthday

and I decided to make a mod on that day

yeah basically

it's showing kind of the process of

making the mod

if that's

interesting

it won't be a proper tutorial so it's

you won't be able to follow along but it

might still be things uh

interesting things to learn

and we can always chat about anything

you would like

I don't know how to see that yeah and I

was thinking

starting early

this would be 10 o'clock in

UTC

with every time that would be in your

time

take UTC plus minus 10 plus minus watch

whatever Offset you have it's always

good to know you're upset and that's

basically it

so

it was a shorter stream

when they

today

but I

yeah I don't know what motor at

so

yeah tomorrow what did I put up tomorrow

I don't even remember my own schedule

it's

I need to have to track my schedule

better

so let's

think this is too much for

okay

it's a bit of a mess I should have

organized this better

but still still new to streaming so I'm

getting you're doing creature it's

sufficient I guess

yeah I was going to continue the uh uh

3D Puzzle like last time

I think that sounds okay and then

I'll see I need to figure out when I

should stream my Monday and Tuesday but

I think yeah I think I should stick to

those other times outside for

but also other days if you have any

feedback I'm open for that

I guess I should go to the store now if

if they yeah sure if you want to I

wanted to see

where was where did I

am a bit confused at the moment

which is not making things he wants to

autoplay everything

so

if your voice is really lovely I like it

thank you

so how about

we go and visit the streamer I was

watching before I started streaming

so I was scared so while I'm coming back

to him

I went back and watching more from him

why not

why don't you come along it's funny he's

a really nice

Point person

he has quite a flashy

dream as well I can impressed by

I think he has made everything himself

and he's actually currently

modeling and blending

which is what I will be doing on

Saturday

so thank you all for showing up and

if

yes you're free to copy

that message and

and paste it in the comments when

we arrived

over at Bermuda cross

EMA for short if you want

I need to organize my address there

I would get better at this but uh thank

you all and see you next time
