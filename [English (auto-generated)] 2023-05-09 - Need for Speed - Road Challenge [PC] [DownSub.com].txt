hello welcome

the

the second stream

with yeah

my thermal intro as usual

hello

that's the only player

last time I completed those two circuits

in the world store

and

I have now also lowered the quality of

the cars since that seemed to be an

issue

and then this coffee shouldn't have

enough family

so

it's the same mesh but it doesn't have

the

perfect Supply to it

it almost looks better without this

it's not shiny I don't know the

shininess is gone I hope that will

improve the performance

okay this there was some performances

well when there was a lot of cars around

class restriction class class B

I mean that that's a bit redundant

anyway let's continue the video of the

world tour

golfing curve

which is that steaks I think yep

[Music]

United States

black card is all right I need a Class B

for this race actually

pink eye

now this one is in this car

which I think

should have high performance

because I think it has been upgraded

which is why the character looks

different

but

wait I should be able to see that from

the garage actually

now I remember

yeah level two

and then you do that now

in that case I should use this car

instead even though it's not pink

sadly

as far as I can see you cannot change

the color of it

but let's

only put one this this game needs some

a thousand separators

but Dolphin Cove

the

Grove what's the code

oh it's a night

one go I hope everything works well with

this thing do let me know if there's any

issues like

loudness of the game

I would say that it does run smoothly

trash doesn't think it's nice but the

mesh just suck and texture should be the

same so that's

great either side of the mountain uh

collided with the

car

it's on one side

one sign has been murdered

[Music]

yeah this is how you want from English

yeah

stole his car

[Music]

and I broke it again

[Music]

I tried to cut the the over the grass

there but

there's a mouth the morning don't we

that ended up terribly

okay

so you're watching

ultimately

[Music]

yeah this track is stuck if you're

watching Eurovision this year

um I might

do that

actually

I haven't actually kept track of when

it's when I

[Music]

mostly watch the

find them

now

and I usually don't

bother looking at with songs

it would be until the competition

it's usually when I hear the songs for

the first time

[Music]

I have no idea which song

wait it is complete competing with

and then they also the local

I don't know what you would call it in

English

[Music]

now it's called while the Swedish name

is Melody

that would be a Melody Festival

but

yeah that's what it works in my case but

the the local song election in Sweden

[Music]

you can also watch that

[Music]

I got tricked by that sign it is so dark

so I can see what I'm wearing okay it's

completely dark here I'm just trying to

use things this isn't going great I

shouldn't have broken it a lot

[Music]

yep that was that side

but yeah

[Music]

yeah I don't think I'll win this race

[Music]

at least we have a head of one car okay

get a few more points

however I do also have the option to

quit the race and if not space

which at least would save the caption

more damages

but in that case well I said I will get

in last position

[Music]

I wouldn't say the game is running

trying to smoother overall

weight is done I can't see anything

except this customer and maybe I should

turn off the Bedford nights

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

isn't it concentrate

these roads here

this part is at least

what

what right delegates oh no no what is

this

and now as far as fast I mean

and I love things I don't think

honestly I lost this race

so I will forfeit this race which means

is really quick I guess this quit

races that [ __ ] only there's that race I

wouldn't come in last position anyway

so let's

repair the car and try again

animation slow

you don't really see the animation

without the glare

then you can check the standings

the points are still based on its

erasers so that's 12 points

there's three race okay I should do

better is it night again

no it's it's just raining two one go

okay

[Music]

now I can at least see the track

yeah

careful there

I don't want to pump the cars

about the cars and I also don't want

the suspension

so

far so good oh

ombre

but that's me like ma'am in Spanish

thank you

foreign

[Music]

and then accidentally bump into that car

that wasn't my

I didn't intend to bump the car that

just happened

it was a sucked into the car because it

was a tornado

oh

and also you recognize it

amazing wishes it's raining yes no

raindrops are humid conventions yeah I

did yeah they just

hit the windshield and then they just

shrink it must be a heated windshield or

something

they evaporate as soon as they hit the

windshield

it's important to have a heated

windshield when you're racing so you

evaporates in the water so it doesn't

accumulate

thank you

or they wipes it with an onion huh

that's what he did before the invention

after the machine boyfriend

this onion

or something

well

it's not an onion animation it's just

covered in white

[Music]

but the water still hits the windshield

I would imagine more water should hit

when she left his key

but

then it's just a bad place immediately

I don't know how it looks

warm water hits the glass white in onion

I don't know I never considered that

the sign survived

[Music]

foreign

Ministries

and I want to see

if I have a chance to at least get

started position in the whole tournament

to get the medal

in the trophy is based on the lowest

metal

left

man

is

[Music]

yeah rain is much easier to deal with

than Darkness for some reason

but I really hope that snowy trash

doesn't have snow because snow is really

really nice to hear it

it makes it even sleepier

rain is easier

because

broken headlights don't humidity exactly

just have to be more careful or have

like

extra lights on the car

it lights everywhere on the car

there's dots on that map are very large

which makes it kind of hard to see what

people are when they are close together

or what kind of what the road is and we

are behind those dots

which may be is the intention

great lap you placed first

they have 42 points that means I am a

third now

let's double check the standings yep

third position that's good

now let's sort my name outside that I

can

that one better track let's double check

uh weather on oh no

do I need to repair the car

badly damage

and I don't know if

I do get the feeling that the

more the car is damaged the harder it is

to get more damage

you'd be wrong about that

three two one go

but if that is true

that means it is

ready to try with the broken car

so you don't get as much damage as long

as you can still win the race

I break

[Music]

my

I don't remember who it has second most

points

that person has to come

further behind

what I can

they get less points that I can actually

pass them pointwise

it does it was probably obvious

Hombres first tornadoes in Kentucky

that's good

[Music]

I should be far behind her so far is

should get second position and in that

case I just have to avoid my tornadoes

catching out with friends that's not

cute

that's funny man good good that's good

[Music]

I wish you good luck Paris

for some of the piece that I want to

remember that the uh

snow mate it's probably when you drive I

can't sleep

this one is actually the completely

finished

having a greater impact

I like this good grip

and bad grid

a creep

where am I doing Swatch afterwards

[Music]

number two okay let's see

can you do this

sorry about the Snowman

[Music]

that's ugly anyway

it's snowman's killed one

bye Snowman

[Music]

chairman

foreign

I think there might be some case where

the D is used for

masculine

with the team or

virginity

anyway

I'm driving Japanese ladies

so far everything is all right

it's definitely I think that kind of

confirms

that the game actually has different

the attraction inside the Thomas and

outside

[Music]

because while driving outside the house

you have that snow effect behind the car

while driving inside the tunnel you can

hear the tires

screechings

and you can also see tire tracks which

you cannot see outside terms

[Music]

it considered them different rounds at

least there's a dead Snowman

and I do feel like there is a difference

interaction

[Music]

yeah I can see the difference in

traction I can't even see it because

that's good I don't know tornado stay

very no

no this isn't good

are they doing fairies

take this a conversation again

don't make me come back then

what [ __ ]

[Music]

[Music]

ing tornadoes

very fast

he's getting a strong lead over sense

[Music]

wait where's

maybe it's really catching everything up

I think it's good

[Music]

[Music]

I'm being haunted

[Music]

final lap

[Music]

96 remember probably

doing

things

where I'm staying

[Music]

huh

now I'm

getting away

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

thank you

okay what's that sign

foreign

[Music]

three two does that work out

congratulations you have successfully

completed this circuit you have been

awarded the gold medal

187 500.

move on to the next circuit

okay so there's only

the high sticks left

you're gonna have to use my pink eye

on good Adam

I don't know how to pronounce that

okay

whereas a skill level Pro I had I

haven't been consider that

it's already true I don't know how many

skill levels there are

pet me down is to see because here it

says bro okay

let's go Patrol

and this is amateur okay

basically compute you've got 11 I would

assume

first so I guess this is how much I paid

overall

that is perfect it is fun

and I can't see how much I spent total a

lot on this circuit it's up

and which cars I have that I can because

of all the pro of course why isn't the

button for that

anyway

entry fee one car

let's see if I'm coming

hydrate

substrate

three two

one go

yeah let's not check must kind of easy

with the class lead card

okay

okay this isn't this isn't starting off

great

[Music]

foreign

I guess we'll see what happens when you

climb in second place

still catch up with me

here in this section

it is a hard place to

sauce

but after that I basically have to

use

[Music]

I can basically if you can't go to the

block

any passing attention

yeah all right let's push again

yes it is wash again

peace

you won't let up his car this time

I don't know if it's random or if it's

like pretty time

eight class car as well

now that didn't work

that was a stupid idea

she just left anyway

[Music]

I wanted to see if I could

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

increasing casual

and then pumpkin

[Music]

and then pumpkin attack

foreign

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

you've won the race and this actually

move and pushed me in lost another car

now a distractions

well one win

s you have won the circuit

congratulations you have successfully

completed and awarded the gold trophy

you're ready to challenge the next tier

I got the two tears oh yeah this is the

special

yeah

cheers

so

moving over to a Memory Lane

I'm back in the eye

fast restriction open so I could

technically

purchase

I don't have money for an egg or it's

not Fanny car season like the fullest

but no I cannot afford

you know too expensive almost just like

this one because

one million

can you miss the first response I almost

lost the purchase your favorite the

first place on the final left oh I see

team left zombie

oh

this is

an upgraded car

so maybe I should use it instead even

though it's not pink I cannot change the

color either

great skill it's fun fun

thank you kitten

I have practiced

nothing between

this and previous stream

and I was starting in last position

at the time it starts when I cross the

stocking line

Grinders that's a lot of cars

my speaker party

that's scraping the wall hey I've

listened to the damage the card is

amazing

that's the damn story

[Music]

and take another card from whoosh

oh she's now broke well

probably

yeah there's no wish in this race so

he's broke

it's a tortoise why would you call this

have tortoise

or is like a reference to the tortoise

and a hand because it's all this is

going to mean

it's true respect to do that

means it has that

and then there's of course bullseye

it sounds exciting

this is

a nice upgraded car

these opponents there are no chance

against the first Pom-Pom

and I had a cow

I find like

whoops you didn't see that happening

[Music]

this time the person's informing

surprises maybe

that was hard to get perspective inside

in game sometimes

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

just crush the car

[Music]

he's uh

[Music]

Lounge

anyways

I'm keeping up with his car

let me bumping up that's it right

from her almost lost their place

but

he had something up for non-existent

sleeves I actually am when he sleeps at

the moment so

all right I guess

perfectly she doesn't wear anything

pushing push

needs one more arms

and leaving him behind for kids yeah he

got in the way it wasn't my fault

the car is not broken no no not at all

oh my God is so amazing

well thank you kitten

let's do a slight repair on this car

like the wind chill is completely broken

elections all the other windows are

there

pretty engine that's

keeping the acceleration at Max

and moving on to Celtic runes

and I realized I still haven't

which I went to this Statistics page

there we go

two watches

right now I'm playing Angry Birds on

Xbox 360s

I should have checked that they were

nice nice guys but this is should be one

of the brighter ones

sit down with the headlights

[Music]

there's plenty of lights on this track

so I can see it

I know there's lots of Lights here

[Music]

it's fine should I fix the headlights

yeah apparently if you don't use down

here but

[Music]

in the flashlight exactly

attached that to the front of the car

that she did

but this is one of the brighter tracks

it has no no problem being in the past

headlights I was like let's turn off the

flash and she just done that before

for now distracting light

[Music]

[Music]

well suffer

it sounds fine

he came rounds better this time than

yesterday

[Music]

and hopefully future

[Music]

okay I don't know I do want to play like

an infinix games but I need to

figure something out

this is a complaint

that was music from those things

and in a country in the places

especially when he's sick

how cute I guess but

it's nice

thank you elevation elevationary

[Music]

most

[Music]

[Music]

concentration

never heard much in our suggested our

game balance if you could try to hear

more of the music or something

I drifted by something

and took it out

of its misborne life

it's a bit sad

oh my

God yeah that you find the words oh my

here comes the car

great lap you've won the race let me go

fast

welcome Astra I was happy to see you

again happy to see everyone here it is

going fast and I'm doing well

a new track hometown

double check that it's not night this

time

it is not night this time

it would be nice if this I understand

like this disabled can change the values

but

it would be nice if the

this screen said something about the

track but

or like here like you've said Catholic

ruins night

Red Rock reach weather or something that

would be nice

oh the onion is perfectly fine

do you like to prepare the me

select one repair each race it's quick

a mouse

a mouse

right

meow

I don't even though I went through the

a track page I didn't check which

country it is but I think you can guess

which country this is

three two

one go

[Music]

[Music]

outside the term Hometown town

[Music]

might be a business misleading

okay

yeah

I said that the developers are I mean

the place is called hometown

[Music]

they actually see this cartoon time is

there a place called hometown

in this country that wasn't blurred

I haven't seen that before

and where inside this country when it is

subscribe

wow that was a shot point or something

which has a red white complete theme

that's a square

beginning of science with miles per hour

with my middle of the roads I mean piano

line Adventures

[Music]

yeah

[Music]

it doesn't like next.com I mean

yeah it's not my hometown

it would be nice with attractive but

yeah the reference

I was close today

please shine with this bright lights in

here but what I meant was that

developers are from Canada

but

this track is not from Canada as far as

I know

tonight

I mean there's only

[Music]

lights

and if I'm on warning signs

yeah just a square a between signs my

driveway it's United States if it's

limited power is Canada and it is around

spilling design it's summer in Europe

I wonder if you can determine which kind

because I think the game is using the

exact same signs from European countries

which is great great lap you've won the

race

there's a hundred times in line does

this look like in annoy

and then it doesn't does have heels like

these huh

yeah crust is still going to be now oh

win if I don't play the next race if you

have enough points you will win the last

race you can actually you don't have to

play the last race and just win

Red Rock Ridge this

I think is United States too

it's like a half the tracks in the

United States oh there is a pack of them

here have you been to attack with them

oh you have to be unpacking now

there's a mission lines and cheats

[Music]

and here's a gas stuff they have The

Chronic gas as well

[Music]

even though it's something completely I

know it's short forecasting

others are dinosaur fossil in this side

of the mountain

s

and that way the most power on this

track is right to the black background

[Music]

now it's everything in lowercase

bridge in Georgia

but this does not look like secure check

there's only in Georgia

I mean

is there any

place in the United States that this

building signs where they break my

spelling black

looks more like New Mexico

[Music]

now I was born in Georgia and never seen

anything like this

[Music]

like

I wonder if you selected coincidence

that new name matches

or if they like kick stuff first name

because they like it but even though

it's not very good location

and here we go to Taco Bell

a motel

an attraction in two minds one of our

construction ends there's this

attraction

foreign

[Music]

this size only has the most power in

Black

and also they have written maximum above

might do that

um

speed limit at the top

because you have to tell people that

this sign stands for speeding it cannot

implied like it in Europe

plus I mean it's hard to write speed

limit if you have hey if you have

restriction of not putting text on sites

[Music]

perhaps

[Music]

it sometimes says that I just have limit

on it what can you translate that

English please

[Music]

great lap congratulations it is

sometimes says that of years have limit

on it yeah you probably have to

translate the things one second

understand

there you go you two one sir go

go I came in first uh four times so that

that's why it's four times thirty Krusty

came in

second four times four times twenty five

but the rest did not come in the same

position four times

as far as I can

yeah let's

let's successfully completed this

circuit you have been awarded the gold

medal

three hundred thousand without him

yeah let's move on for next second what

is this

it's

two laps five opponent modified

you seem like the same kind

of second race viewer opponents more

tracks

but this one introduces Atlantica and

Rocky pass which I think both are United

States too

because I think rocket pass is a version

of

uh what's called Red Rock Ridge I didn't

remember

can I see the dress from here I like how

I switch tracks I have to leave

[Music]

and this sign sometimes speak

uh your English yeah this design is

sometimes speed limits other times yes

limits oh design sometimes USB limits on

it all the time says

I don't know what's going on with my

phone it doesn't like English yeah

you're in English

besides sometimes says just speed limit

wait doctor says being limit on it but

it's time to adjust it

that's something yeah I get what you

mean now

and three pieces 71 250 I don't know

what it is random

I have bad English

it's fine my use isn't perfect item

there we go there's some nice driving

uncomfortable

[Music]

and we are Inlet

France

[Music]

two naps I should be able to do this

is

[Music]

in fourth position

he doesn't like that

I'll see you through here

[Music]

we go

we got screened

[Music]

which is

I think they kind of wanted to have like

username

name stuffy Brothers

[Music]

Minds having like

more realistic things

effects

[Music]

okay that's oh that's Yeah final corners

as I feel like that sign was amazing

[Music]

[Music]

much concentration

oh I see oh all right I see that we have

anything

an outfit change I have I find it I will

do so

as soon as there

do you really wants to have me those

things be automatic

that would be when I fix the plugin

[Music]

probably so when I make Quantum and this

I will definitely have that thing

be handled dynamically and

this problem basically has been redrawn

China

I could also add additional outfits ah

fireworks yeah

wrong time to get the fireworks

despite my favorites

they're distracting me

[Music]

no

yeah

[Music]

I I didn't do that in fashionist

actually

foreign

I wasn't reading messages this time

trust me okay I need to do that

and then I basically have to remember

that if 36.

[Music]

first is it nighttime driving

it is not it doesn't matter

okay let me let me get to the comments

now

says it's because the urine cannot write

your phone wants to speak French

this one was in Canada

I don't know it's in Canada but I'm

planning a vacation in Canada I'm 11

hours away from here that's

that's a bit or from Canada

I

welcome

I think let me know if how you want it

to be read

but that now this thing works with the

right thing doesn't work

I second time I'm being rated

and I'm still at the estate so

let's let's see

because of course mama said so

Ponyo how are you I'm doing

oh hydrate

I'm doing all right and very happy to

see so many people be here

I find it's just happy trading you are

missing I don't have any like

set up

the best I have that shout out

which doesn't have autocomplete so I can

do this

it's been a while since I

was on your screen

so let's start with that what's this

stream since I don't have the plugin

that tells me I should add that so I can

so it can let me know

just welcome everyone else

yeah I'm I'm very inexperienced with

with reading and I'm learning and I'm

trying to think I can think of what

everyone else is doing when they get

traded

[Music]

so

[Music]

thank you

for reading

because I have the question yeah

I am trying to read comments while

running and that's definitely not a good

Commission

and that does make me a big challenge to

play this game

especially as the cars

you know faster fasting relating to the

game I guess

[Music]

when I get traded

like

I like

and you're honestly man

that's it yeah I think like

yeah I definitely have to learn

and yeah because I think I don't

remember how many people they were in

here

there's another 27 yes

I haven't had so many people at the same

time

I'm expecting nervous

[Music]

and

then I'm going to certainly here

[Music]

so um

[Music]

[Music]

no I got back enough in this cars this

car is broken up

[Music]

yeah that's

the person have done this my screen

before and I can understand here

all right

and it doesn't matter I assume

[Music]

um yeah I haven't run but I hope this

rest of this team is great playing it

and thank you and I hope you had a great

stream

yourself and you're doing great

I'm not doing anything strange because

I'm very distracted

too

[Music]

and

[Music]

oh hiring

thank you thank you

and that that price of rocking that is

a dragging on the ground the suspension

control this afternoon

see you on the flip side I want I need

to show

being

H1 here stills

now and this is

I don't know if I can win gold anymore

Chad I hope you're well

hello everyone

yeah because

yeah basically remember

problem is I don't see so much of the

chat and I can't see when I I think I

can get this

this should help me see more of the chat

actually

but then I can't see

this stuff isn't the best

I'm working with my head

this might

this might help

okay

let's go to the bottom me chat

it's gonna treat her beauty

with the chat

okay let's

yeah I replied the car the headlights

are working in case if it's night

driving Atlantica they should also be

United States

I really need to remember

I mean of course you're right

I have one go you know that's how I get

stressed I don't really know how can I

say come back

yeah yeah thank you again for the rates

veggie and or Reiki I don't know how you

want it and uh

and yeah

have a nice day

it's a perfect name

keeps you from

leaving and if you need

my voice

[Music]

up and down from the road then that

wasn't good I'm already damaged engine

100

so

[Music]

in a racing track

so this I get

um there's another one

[Music]

about aquatic

theme from this island

palm trees

[Music]

now assuming this is United States I

don't think this is Canada

[Music]

we can determine that by

speeding aside

on this track

does it

[Music]

I know it drives through the signs

not a good idea

I do think it's a good idea it's speed

bump in places where people don't

respect

at his feet

[Music]

empty terrible at this space

[Music]

well item

no this one but it looks like oh wait

you said you played this game how much

did you play this game

I don't think there's any console like

this is the PC version

if there was an offense for me losing my

mouth pointing and my husband and stuff

I didn't really played the chat Champion

campaigns oh yeah I think that's where

you unlock the trash other than that

cheat stuff please

so I think I would start with the

defense back in the day and yeah

[Music]

yeah yeah that's

[Music]

modern racing games not playing against

it unlockable tracks more cars they have

everything from

which I think is the case

dependency because after this you have

what Pursuits two I think because I

think it's one is

[Music]

okay for this

and the game of this opposite two maybe

this was a good thing between uh

[Music]

now I don't see the number of students

watching

[Music]

huh

okay on the track

[Music]

and not when it costs 1 000

damage

so you're staying arm they're not I mean

that means you didn't respect this bit

don't buy it so you find the sounded

unless you don't think property Mark but

that's not because of this feedback that

was because of the internet

the lack of proper marketing

conversation

um yeah I don't remember I don't

remember what's the meaning this person

looks the best

that's why I think

even though it doesn't perform at least

on Modern computers

[Music]

definitely at least get past this

journey

and I want to First finish line yet at

least

oh

[Music]

terrible crash at the end of the race

that's not mine that's no one took

damage okay I need to see this spot I

should probably pop out

this

like that okay back to again

well I think

game game the card table damage I repair

the engine and these settled with that

for now

I'm actually surprised about the damage

detail in this game

I'm trying to

a rocket pass is actually yo wait isn't

this isn't

yeah this isn't the the alternative

version of Red Rock Red treat wait is it

Rocky pass the alternative version of

we need no level which I would name it

is it's probably the popular television

of a different snow level actually

the uh actually not because the

the

broken winners are with winter but

a very sharp polygons

and otherwise it's mostly deformed mesh

I'm gonna say it's I did I didn't say

it's high detail just by about the

damage details has

I don't feel like it is that much to be

honest

you mean Snow Ridge yeah and Snow Ridge

is United States that's what the game

said

and Rocket pass I thought was a version

of which is the low snowy version of

Snow Ridge but this is Canada so that

can't be the case

but

I do think this is a slow version of

this track

[Music]

which of course has a different name

thank you

this looks a bit Canadian

[Music]

I mean for this time I think it's kind

of impressive yeah yeah I get I mean I

get that he meant the

considering the age of the game

but

[Music]

I mean

to me it's more like yeah

it's what I expected from the

games okay I guess kinda I don't feel

like the deformities on the cars are

that much

it yet let's see I guess I should try to

break the car as much as possible at

something just to see

I mean I got this

don't really have any other games to

compare because I don't know

how can I accept it

like yeah that's that's what should be

for this

era of things

that's bad

[Music]

ouch yeah

great safety kitchen

the body has taken

difficult damage

and additional benefits

and that's even good to have this guy

hey all right

okay I'm in recycling so

hey how did you recover that quickly

[Music]

I don't hear anything against Saturday I

just hate you

just because of your name

[Music]

oh lift up

I didn't have a train

and the other Canadian track also has

trained

are they only trains in Canada no other

place in the world

[Music]

oh your mirrors she's gone

the mirror is fine

yeah

there's lots of important things

that kind of turn right and

why does it

say that

[Music]

he can't change as he goes into nature

it feels like a

battle sign

[Music]

if I think that jump at correct speeds

let's get over it very smoky

[Music]

[Music]

hello Factory

uh who needs mirrors no one's again

speaking of facts

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

they have a snowflake that does that

mean

[Music]

another product

anymore I'm gonna

it's a break at this point anyway

[Music]

all right off the road again I think I

did that last time

okay Captain Finish Line before what a

catch up

congratulations

I haven't been driving one

yeah I'm not doing great here

congratulations you have successfully

completed this circuit you have been

awarded the bronze medal I'll eat

something

I can't pay the car with that money

I mean if that's it are expensive to

replace

luckily

not in this game

to the next circuit

circuit three

yeah

that car is totaled yeah

I don't have the Chrome effects it's

harder to see the bumps and everything

but it does improve the performance of

the game even though it's really old

game it performs badly

this Windows 10 computer

it needs Flex tape

so

oh

I really want that information so

backwards and United States

the entry fee is somehow less than the

last place

so the only way you can lose money is if

you damage your car too much

I need to replace my belts and belt

tensions on my car and some other things

are they hate me yeah I have to do stuff

on my car and I don't have a lot for

that

[Applause]

no yeah that's I don't see my car likes

that

I'm too much about this

I just had much extra taste but it was

that expensive but most expensive

[Music]

you need to get gold or promise

yet

I don't know if

because in the

head-to-head I don't know that's my

window broken

[Music]

and I'm like water and dirt and snow it

doesn't matter right

they're very large oh that's fine and

there's no crap just a hole

[Music]

here we go

[Music]

[Music]

you technically come in second place but

I don't know if you get a similar for

that

or if you just lose it and get nothing

[Music]

because I have to watch that game

foreign

[Music]

I always feels nice to drive with a new

clutch

I think so

awesome

should maybe get their eyes

it was fine like 2015 Euro

yeah I stopped

[Music]

pretty expensive

it's nice not paid at first but

yeah

like in my situation that's still

expensive and that's investment but

regardless how about the correct the

windshield maybe I should have followed

them the person behind what they was

beanie suit grandma

in Germany we say

promised I don't know what I'm saying

eventually

is probably a great text

like this this track is so curly

so

follow me

[Music]

you know now I'm now touching the size

of the world way too much

[Music]

safe pass

es okay

[Music]

some seconds left

[Music]

Finance with all factions

what do you mean

um

I see

two seconds

[Music]

[Music]

hey

so I didn't think too much about this

but that would make sense because

otherwise you wouldn't have said hi

[Music]

that's happening

[Music]

he's passing away church I'm after

Christmas

anyway

but I'm crying I'm trying my best

that's that's that's what I wanted to do

[Music]

she promised

possibly

yeah the they have a passenger in that

car and then just shot the window and I

thought out of the way and didn't get

hit

foreign

[Music]

and now I'm driving from him because

they're trying they're trying to get me

and they

'll only get a business

but this is not going to keep a distance

from them

this is how you let them catch up

[Music]

and it was passed by a lot at least

that's what the Chinese

it was just a rock

got from the other car

very aggressive racing it's

[Music]

if you bring a gun to racing it's

aggressive

unless you mean by Brandy which is kind

of interesting to me but they have a gun

I need to run from them

[Music]

that's me I'm not scared at this time

I'm playing the track it's a bad trip I

want another trip I don't think so and

there Ambrose but it's your stress

thinking

[Music]

that's something new

[Music]

last left so I can get to the comments

after getting through these corners

[Music]

thank you

[Music]

I killed another sign yes you know that

didn't happen

[Music]

I've never had a sign

or defenseless sign

[Music]

I'm very quite a lot outside

[Music]

that's your best lap congratulations

keep cars to pump them so far oh yeah

yeah maybe it is what if it is whoosh

inside that car who asked if he could

ride alone here

I mean it wasn't

no I won't continue that yet

um

Define

Fernando is faster

Fernando is faster than you can you

confirm your own

I can confirm that I cannot I don't

understand

in the message

this game is crazy

four signs all they want to do is give

information

that is true they that's the only thing

they want to do

now to Canada

and this time it's nightcriming so I

need to repair the body because the

headlights are broken

and let's bring the headlights back

there we go

let's start early signs that's what they

get for being the way

at least yeah they are in the way when

I'm driving

the big room for the Pom-Pom

s so if you have like

because I can't see that stuff at the

moment

sorry

um I'm doing time at the moment sorry

I just realized that

I don't see activities

right there

and also

it should be back to that

so let's see

this is a chat

there is what's going on

yes what's going on with redeems and

stuff

yeah I kind of need to rearrange this

stuff

I'm doing my best I I don't have a

second screen if I had that that would

help so much

uh damn F1 check didn't work now

I don't I don't know much about F1 other

than they are special build cars that

goes around the track I do have one F1

game I should maybe play that

hello pump on and Company hello

Rota

yeah yeah she was supposed to go with

Roth I think

okay back to release

hydrated which was redeemed twice and I

didn't see it

because I made the chat he said to read

info

but now I can see that stuff too

I realized that now that I have to look

at that

okay I need to be careful

these aren't such great timelines

because they basically make everything

White

so either is very just white second to

The Exterminating or it's black

something on your head and high things

moving them in a way and it's

concentrating on staying together

[Music]

or you need to comment section because

but yeah

on there

Thursday and Friday

you have to see and I will play the the

giant spiral The Legend of Spyro

actually hopefully if that game works

and in that case I will be thankful to

read the comments

all right I'm going to play it on my

PlayStation mini like I want

oops that's enough

by killer sign

I should maybe try to place the computer

which is what I've got in front of me so

I can can I have the chat thinking

bye

[Music]

they brought disappeared

and then a lot of trees appeared from

playing and my headlights are gone and

just

what you say put salt in your wounds

[Music]

my headlights are gone

because the road just suddenly

disappeared

and there's a rock yeah I think I lost

this space

I do have one headlight

it gives me a bit of light

um

I don't have any audience

yeah I think I lost this face and

perfect

or fight

yeah I don't speak English

don't really watch F1 for myself but I

do remember as a kid I was watching it

with my father when Schumacher

shoe

Market

I think it's like I don't think it was

still driving there wasn't a

disqualified for some reason

I have an F1 game

oh which one

and turn on the high beams blind

everyone gets in front of you that's the

illusion I lost that race

at War tree

uh having a country country boots this

is the snowy version of that track now

and remember

what's the other one comes

where is Razor Edge the count number of

dead signs yeah Edge come in here you

can hear me right

F1 2017 is the game I have I think I

have these thousands

but it's actually something there at 20

or something I got free on Steam

by code Masters

electron in front of me

I am ahead of trump I just need to take

these corners of your friends

wait a minute

but I was there a United States Park why

does that sense in miles per hour

I don't think this this

middle of the road is white

what is going on

what kind of apparenting universe is

this this is a Snelling version of a

different track

is this new version of hometown

[Music]

[Music]

oh

a new message from their 420 Penny hello

driving is so fun

[Music]

when it's snowing it is

it's no fun because it gets really

slippery

definitely no fun okay especially since

the computers are not affected by

weather

but at least it seems like they do Drive

slowing but I could be wrong right there

you don't do anything because

but it could be a one-way road so there

will be no yellow nine or something it

doesn't feel like a one-way Road no see

there's a sign that for you in another

Direction it's not the one we wrote

it's just

it's a two-way road with a white Middle

Lane

oh here we got someone here yellow

it's a weird threat

so at the time of day

being one connection is disappears but

they still put up science like agility

versions

strange tracking day

[Music]

[Music]

I'm fine being smart thank you

I mean

I would say Olivia was the smart one

that came up with the one-way idea

the designs doesn't

perfect

is that flag is that

a shirt and make it you had picture I

made it to the queen and I'll answer

another donut shop

because this is United States

this is a Fusion from a track from Need

for these three is

this and you brought that up is Need for

Speed three a Hot Pursuit

[Music]

do I remember that meeting

and it's Need for Speed 5 Hot Pursuit 2

when roster again in between or was the

game only consider a spin up yeah I

appreciate I remember that correctly at

least

acne purposes I haven't played half

receipts

that made their [ __ ]

I played a lot of this game

which is why I wanted to play this game

and I've played family girl too but not

the first one

I played a Hot Pursuit 2 but not the

first one

Trend here

are there any other Need for Speed 2

versions

too

[Music]

well

on PS1 it's called high stakes I think

uh the game is called high stakes in

North America and Road challenge in

Europe as far as the information I've

gotten and which may be the name changes

depends on Console too but that's that I

don't haven't read about

[Music]

yeah

that's what it is

[Music]

not wrong about that that would be very

confusing that he's gonna get far wasn't

it that hit yeah I didn't get so far in

this game either when I was young

another completely I heard from David

later but

not when I first came

[Music]

comments I'm trying but it's nice

reading comments

there is donut shop

don't know what it's called it's

something donut

s

[Music]

peace

since it is a Canadian game if I'm not

mistaken I think

performance

[Music]

and it does look better on PC yeah

that's what I want to think situation

yeah my

so the title of my stream is called

Studio challenge

[Music]

while the game it depends on which

region or service you're using so on

Twitch it will actually change between

high stakes are ordered challenge

depending on language on which

so but for all the like I have added in

yeah

message on Discord and that will alert

when I started to start a screen

platform and move on the link in North

American Title I wish I could change it

because I mean I am Swedish so it would

sit okay

yeah

I will head over to Tim Hortons to get

the donuts I'm from Australia hello

um hello from downtown

uh yeah in this game was after six

o'clock high stakes in Australia let's

see maybe some research on the python

because I did help out

yeah fancy

igdb

not to be confused with the IMDb

and where they have this information and

I want to

because they didn't actually like being

European fighting of this game

and it is the service which is using to

show departments I have some

bad I'm a bit behind on the comments

[Music]

Instagram we could do some exploring of

this crafts too because I asked me past

them

[Music]

and see how

the game doesn't love letting you get

off the track too much but there's not

much to explore outside the trash

and then when I was quite far to the

girls yeah

it's like I try to skip the reprise

[Music]

until you come from Finland down I'm

dead

or something

hey I set up a Discord command

Why didn't it work

[Music]

it should it should add beneath

[Music]

it should have

that much wind

I definitely know how I set up in this

apartment

I

can't post anything

but it should have done that oh there is

a pump on this one there is a pump on

this Square

[Music]

babies

he's a very bare bone server it's not

much

can I spin on this track of 10 minutes

[Music]

this is just four laps

and I wouldn't be surprised there's an

eight left

with weather

collected 20 minutes to complete

hope you're ready for that first

there you go

okay let's see yes I'm going to get the

link

because I have close down everything the

same performance so

just let me quickly check

yeah

because I'm using stream elements

because it's free

I think this card is good to go for

another race

so let me quickly go to the chatbot

check commands

custom commands

I have the Discord

did I forget to say

this

word

there

let me get the link

and okay I have to get the link anyway

I want Discord

disconnect already

I have I obviously have infinite because

I'm streaming at the moment

foreign

I will share the link whenever disco

decides to connect

online

I probably have to restart this one

okay we're starting this course your

card is at the decal and yeah that would

be nice

is it working now

okay it's working now I had to restart

this card

and we should do this but

the link say

all right is it safe I assuming thing

now we can test it see if it works

just type Discord and then I should have

some alienses like

[Music]

that's awesome

since I choose that too

so is it working

now is testing the command

okay

all right Alex is a heavy extremely see

now it's working

[Music]

there we go

hooray hopefully there isn't too

completes the surface and take off you

think well I will continue this race

in Lost Canyons lost cannons should be

an alternative version of a

a red rock

Red Rock Ridge I don't remember the name

of the brick track

I drink

yeah yeah and you take my kind of like

there's a red Sun why is that the red

moon

what's that sign upside down

[Music]

Can't Stop

right there very bright

lights shining

so anyway

so yeah this is Delta track of me or

even promise remembering about that

track is called Red Rock something

[Music]

it kind of feels like I'm driving on the

silence

apparently tilted

[Music]

above the track is a bit different

[Music]

one scientific

wasn't my Inception it just happened Red

Rock Rich yeah what's happening what to

drink this place looks like FIFA

puta

[Music]

I don't know I have no idea

I'll take your word for it

[Music]

do they have

[Music]

credit cards the broken stocks

dragging I'm asking

suspension can't hold off the car

[Music]

it's not much about components I'm not

sure the previous tracks were are more

active pre opponents and candies like

the previous circuit came more of a

challenge than these components

[Music]

and they're supposed to be the same

[Music]

other side

[Music]

and yeah I'm quite exploring you can

also like

yeah that sounds

easy

look at what place names are the signs

since we don't give a good level

characters

or did I just pass through it

[Music]

I had a wolf

[Music]

yep

don't mind smoking High

practice love Korea wasn't me

now it's about to carry out find out on

your teeth

[Music]

and you don't have to name this time but

but next time

[Music]

when it's an actionable

[Music]

[Music]

or something

guess what is a kidney so some of the

new head chef happened

but it's just kidding now I apprecially

it's not just kidding it is kicking he

can't hit it no

deciding me I don't know I don't think

there's any cat sounds in this game

he's a presumably coyote another wolf is

pig horse cow

and different kinds of birds

he's gonna do that

[Music]

there's probably dogs as well actually

[Music]

[Music]

trying to think about what other

[Music]

yeah I hope you can hear the music from

his heart sounds

I said I can only suggested on this

as requested

[Music]

Facebook friends music indeed

it's just that music is kind of quiet

it's doing everything

[Music]

wait you have to bring them many animal

sounds

I think it should be there

[Music]

[Music]

I can't make crazy music a bit louder

you can make a car sound like

[Music]

this

okay while I crashed anyway let's check

we can increase the raise the music then

we can lower that for anything

[Music]

it's fine I'm okay with it

the engine noise might be a bit Samy

sounding

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

okay

I can't get on the site for what

all right puts the two wheels on the

mountain one

hey you're not gonna have to pass me

I am fun fun

okay to drive

I mean I'm not just been drinking

alcohol at least

[Music]

that's what you're asking

I will get us here on the test

types in the other side

oh excellence

okay I guess you have to pay stupid

cactuses later bye

[Music]

hello Stella

a great moment they've come in when I'm

impressed

I was leading the race the whole time

alone I'm doing

terrible sets yeah look away

okay I need to catch up

okay

drivers

for some reason

opponents that's good time

enemies they are my enemies

I don't know I killed another sign

I need Science Center

I said they only give information they

don't feel much

I'm a business driver though

right

okay but

um

let's add

I have chosen

to basically never drink alcohol myself

but I assume

you can't drink

my orders of your doctor or something

and

maybe workplace I don't know

because I'm not about that

you're free to share if you want

turkey

that's the sound of me

those road signs really jump out in

front of you don't they yeah

see

they always get in my way

it doesn't responsible for taking down

the other side for 20 minutes starts but

he never does that

another step

the time I do that now now

the car isn't that broken is it

don't look at the orange numbers

congratulations

but I have one more point and probably

that's that's what congratulations

successfully complete

conflicted awarded to gold medal

150 000.

rounds

then I can't drink alcohol because I

made a promise to my assets

yeah it's self-inflicted that's not the

correct time my grandfather when I was

10 leveraging alcohol or smoke

cigarettes when I get done

move move on to the next circuit I kinda

did that too but not stitching like a

grandfather

I just it's a self self promise I guess

and I kept that ever since

even though people try to

get me to drink

sometimes

so this is a knockout

to our opponents four tracks

so every track a person a driver will be

knocked out

so all I had to focus on now is just

enough to get into last place

yeah I don't drink alcohol I don't smoke

cigarettes I don't do

as news it's a Swedish Thing

and

what I'm sister I don't do drugs

unless it's free medical come on

yeah at one point any gold

it's all I needed

I prefer to drink his vodka

have a have a feeling out of the kids

City

I completely detail support yeah but

yeah I think that chemical

s

they are of course different variants a

podcast

but this point on Earth about the name

of this track

yeah I just needs to not get in that

position doesn't matter which position

he gets

it's preferably from Poland of course

exactly you know I don't need brands in

Poland

[Music]

maybe I can see if they exist in Sweden

[Music]

hence

no I don't remember this details

[Music]

[Music]

yeah come out I can't expect

but I don't think I would buy

I don't know brands

anything like that

has to be expected

[Music]

you don't want to fight the opponents

because all you have to do make sure

that you don't get in last position

pushing the photos around just risks new

putting damage

[Applause]

like that

what the f17 fast

not just taking damage driving on them

oh I'm buying myself

apparently that's understanding

[Music]

and then service

town

it manages this now this buildings are

very expensive health

[Music]

[Music]

lap two

left two

[Music]

that talk about singing It's electronic

things

[Music]

so I've got

money driving this track eight laps

which I do think is is nothing

you do drive with Frosty cars so I think

the lap times become shocking

[Music]

this car is just Class A

and there's Tripoli

[Music]

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

not survive

[Music]

19.

[Music]

death is very quiet now a message

I just think it's these corners

and of course

nice on me

someone about avalanches oh yeah

nothing important

thing yeah that's not important

signs are important

then why did they Place themselves you

can drive over them and exactly are that

important

excuse me with signs and stuff up and

putting it on

looks like you killed this thing's

happened

yeah I can uh

yeah collided

and it seemed to survive that though so

one's done

thank you

[Music]

okay now

that's it there's no one else but I was

outside [ __ ]

right now

I'm getting

[Music]

ready to move

so I'm packing appointment all my stuff

that's my fun for today

are you moving far

I'm gonna take a few questions

and

start upside down

anyone else not this the road Stripes

I I don't know what you're talking about

the vampire Road stripes

I I don't know what you're talking about

this must be something new on UC

I don't have a side view mirror so next

they are there

they are behind me let us know what

you're talking about

I think he needs glasses

[Music]

until we have here top of the skin I

know you meant that

now I'm learning one street hour not too

far away yeah that's not too far away

that makes moving easier too

you can buy it basically

grab your stuff and move it by hand

for like your own car and make multiple

streams that person gives that kind of

stuff

yeah

taking bad care of his car even though

the owner trying to do stuff I should

not just get lost messages

Let Us sell my car

except the engine because it's a rear

engine so if I

try to head first to eat the wall it

doesn't damage the engine

oh no

so I was finally done but now there's a

whole left

I'm not even left again

I noticed this this and survived

unfortunately yeah they are like the

trees that are indestructible

oh no

not the string plants

[Music]

[Music]

yeah it should consider the weight of

the car the speed you're traveling and

what kind of and he went kind of seeing

you driving into

and how

much force do you need to

basically

takes down a Street Lamp

I don't know

and a tree forever

and it depends on how thick the trees

works like this series are very thick so

maybe maybe they would survive

don't have time for that she will take

everything out

[Music]

it doesn't take out me

I really love me take out

and you want to take someone out on a

date

when you want to

take out some food

yeah when you want to

take out someone's life

I'm coming several things

[Music]

well in that case I could possibly take

out everything just different ways of

taking out

[Music]

each time

[Music]

Savannah

[Music]

[Music]

get out of my way

want to eat

[Music]

ah just from there you tell me about

that idea from One Piece which

[Music]

I mean if I'm too big and someone I'm

beating because that means one to beat

but it doesn't look like one to be it's

one to be in this race

trying to spots in the way

[Music]

[Music]

well yeah

this has been quite serious

[Music]

[Music]

congratulations

I came first athlete

yeah I don't know how to explain it like

removed from

it I rate getting in your way and

stopping yeah that was very huge we

should disqualify irate

why doesn't these things show up in same

order as in game

maybe I should repair the aliens here

but I don't need headlights I'm pretty

sure

okay there we go snow Ridge is United

States yes

and Summit is the Norway version of the

Canadian track whatever that one's got

wait who got disqualified there man

[Music]

three two one go yeah everything one two

three

[Music]

okay this time I need to be careful

they would have been from

the mirrored the track

and now it's left hand running

but they could have done it so that they

actually

yeah

click the signs out the sides because

since the tracks I think the narrow

tracks have separate clients in the game

I feel the science

they could have done that

so it's still the right hand training

even a mirror streak

I don't see anything

[Music]

or maybe there isn't a separate track

for me or maybe it's just that some

pictures are set too near and some

assets to nothing

that's the case

[Music]

what what

oh no it's starting snow now

another Dynamic

it's not it is

[Music]

can you have a bad storm outside right

now oh

doesn't sound good

oh storm

sounds like you ready

how bad is it

secret science right now are going oh

that's awesome

I've never had warning signs or bad

weather

and so

that would be quite the experience for

me

foreign

is coming

everything important

which okay I see myself

thank you

that's why I should continue to read

them try

we had a tornado hit a village nearby oh

tornadoes I haven't seen such as

haven't

scary

[Music]

that's that was yesterday

maybe let's survive my car didn't

survive that

Russian trying to extract through that

thing

I should be safe and travel it's

you know they might need to be here

today

foreign

[Music]

[Music]

yeah

the readers was okay

that's good

[Music]

right now the sky is dark

enough of Nike and Thunder

I wonder here there's no other secret

sirens

going on

yes

it's dark sky

the killer things

you know what I'm saying

scared

yeah that's it

[Music]

[Music]

this reminds me of the time when

they call it an average signal but it's

basically

pronounced it maybe they have different

signals

a general

Danger

and

when it goes up I have response I

remember since this or like nothing

also scenes but before this incident

I have never heard it go off

aside from the scheduling tests

which

is the way that so which is a good way

so I know what it sounds like

when it's a test

at one time it went out when it wasn't

the best

that was scary

effects apparently it was also a test it

was just not meant to

it was supposed to be an internal test

but they accidentally

made it

so

try to do the comment again

lost power but phone works yeah if you

have bathrooms on what if you should say

in your bathroom not to watch the Stream

better than that

seems like a better idea to have a

charge you've won the race in case you

need it or something

[Music]

it is fine

I write this gun yes

they want to be the and still not beaten

yet

let's repair the engine

I was kind of back what does that mean

so a new track

Empire City which is

in Scotland for some reason

I didn't know this track was in Scotland

it doesn't come off as a Scottish track

but he said something healthy or inside

is it it's broken

yeah Empire City is not Scotland

is this a bug in the game

yeah it says Celtic drinks

well

let me sing play Arcade sing a race

let's go to yeah and remember

it says Scotland

all right wait it's French there okay

let me change their prices

there you go United States

this is impressively

yeah it didn't come off

each track

the game

credence

bye great

I don't know how to read that if you

treat them as I write

now we have a tornado warning nearby oh

keep safe I hate tornadoes I

understandable

yeah be careful not sure I mean you're

you're inside I see the safe location

[Music]

yes I'm safe that's good

in the house

on this I can feel it

I hope this is dark where's my

headlights

what is it because it says that what is

right I put them up when you want

I don't know if I could put them up

hairstyles blinking red light

another Staffing I haven't never been

anything yellow light

I guess it's called Amber Knight

blinking yellow

for this

a general warning

that's the traffic light that's not

apply

so for an intersection you apply regular

rules as the next section with blinking

yellow is

most commonly seen

and the traffic lights and sounds of

function as water

but the traffic light can have a blink

red towards in in like Sweden which

follows the Indiana

driving license

[Music]

in Europe do you have leaning green with

white sauce yellow or Amber but

I don't think that's valid

playing your radiation means to treat it

as a stop sign

okay

[Music]

[Music]

now it's raining

exercise

[Music]

this is a nice track you see

those are fun but not tenacious

I don't like storms I do

foreign

[Music]

Village is getting ready

close for safe reasons

yeah this is

great left lap three unless it's

obviously

but I wouldn't I wouldn't have happened

certain situations so great

if if my city were to close City storms

let's make lights

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

find another thing

right there's another science here today

I should set the card to making no

damages

and then just exploring arms

fresh

three hours and I forgot the time

because we've been crying here that's a

nice time in here

[Music]

any comments being worried about

you can help me

answer my problem

[Music]

that was fun

I think that was close

[Music]

[Music]

we can also turn off the music and then

listen to the ending

that was nuts

it looks like Matthew is

then

my thumb is probably so good

it has a stupid joke

straight into your walls

premium

[Music]

and you can't

take a short cluster here

I've been much of a short myself

[Music]

you've won the race

you've won the race but at what cost

Maki has been eliminated

good riddance an Aquatica is a version

of

what was that aquatic level again

I can do this

yellow silver

quartet cap does it give the correct

track now

it says

yeah United States

Musa

I caught yeah what was

for some reason I can't remember how to

try things

but it was Atlantic

three two

one

okay

yeah

this is a variant of effort want to be

here you want to beat what do you have

it right that's like saying I'm here

I'm saying that I want to beat that I

don't have that with my cards

[Music]

just saying

oh

these things start

he doesn't like me

and also the fountain shares of this

designs

essentially the easiest way

fancy and stylish not really

the yellow line is on the left side here

and I like one in the laptop

my voice and this is making fun

why am I talking about

recipes but what I remember is that you

have

the yellow line TNA

and if it's a one-way Road wait if you

trust yeah if it's a one Range Rover

there's a team right now if you have to

get a lines

and if you have the yellow line on the

right side and then someone made out

you're driving without a break

if you wrote something there

yeah quite funny sounds so cute thank

you okay I'm I'm happy but I think that

I'm so cute I want some kids because I'm

Gonna Keep It

it's my kill and I think I'm succeeded

Tower

wait that was that must bring the lady

they had

someone again

yeah twitch when you need to do

something about

being there fine

lap two I'm gonna be honest with you

okay and you're fine being honest I have

no idea what you thought

what

bad bouncing house yeah you don't know

what spring delays

if you don't know what it is

that's fine

if you're new to watching streams that's

understandable

and if you're not need swatching things

you might have just have fun at about it

basically stream play is the time it

takes for your comments to be written

until you see each other on screen

[Music]

it seems perfectly enjoyable

yeah

that is during delay and

or unless you were talking about when I

was talking about the yellow line yeah

yeah

and if you were talking about the

airlines that should be something

you should know if you're driving

over there in the United States

[Music]

and then you should confirm if I'm

pregnant

yes yellow lines yeah

so as far as I know in the United States

it's my thoughts applied to Canada

Norway and maybe a few other places

wait can I drink this out

and the yellow line marks the middle of

the road

and you drive on the right side of the

neckline

and therefore the heightened and

therefore you should always have the

headline to your left

[Music]

and if you have again mind to your right

you're going in the wrong direction

and one of my experience also have

yellow lines maybe not all of them they

might actually mean as well

if you have a name

that can switch directions depending

what kind of thing such maybe there's a

yellow line on both sides

if that's the case that means that this

whole row is one way and they switch

Direction on it although there was

arrows there

[Music]

are on the side

yeah there's like arrows like that's it

for the arrows this is

these three times

but in that case it should have been

yellow because I should

and of course yellow line Sports

differently in different countries I

think

[Music]

on both sides

marked like the edge of the road

tonight you went to my camera hit me the

right to work fine but

more online thing to pay you more

attention to this

I can't do that too

I can't understand that diamond is down

anyways yeah and sometimes sometimes

yeah I got my gun license in New Mexico

all right

it's been a while since I have to

remember that this company

yeah I don't know how Mexico works with

those markings

so

that I don't know

or in for example Sweden

okay

one in Sweden yellow

line smart temper and lines

so you for example have road

construction and they have to change the

names a bit

for example sometimes they

make the names scenario the snow Stone

Mountain

road if they can work

it still have the same number of names

these are on new Lanes

like yeah these are new Lanes with

yellow markings quite still keeping the

White markings and that's true also if

they're doing construction and to move

shift over

at every lane one lane

they would also use the yellow marking

for the shifting lanes and then it's

back to life

yeah yeah

[Music]

so if you drive in Sweden and you come

across yellow lines on the road they

those takes priority over the way

as you said it it makes it come here

it's yellow and white in some cities oh

that's interesting

maybe it's not consistent

ly

that could be wrong

yeah it's kind of

the body is cracking another asphalt

because the suspension comes up anymore

[Music]

oh look about

Apple

[Music]

where are these guys now the part is now

everybody

cans Parts flying

okay

hanging against the Moon

someone already

connected

and finish line

in these corners

great lap you've won the race

yeah that's some beef and I've caught

and this past

19. congratulations you've won The

Knockout you have been awarded to Gold

Medal half a million

I'm

162 500.

I just don't get those today

and 750 or at 250

. move on to the next circuit

so

that's been three hours now and I am

feeling a bit tired

so

I will exit again

and there you go

there there I said

there's going to be no party of the car

yeah the whole car will fall off

yay I don't have one I'll drink after

cleansing down the stream

don't worry about it I will

or I can refund those hundreds again

still

that was fun what did you think about

that racing I mean the last race

I guess I was tired

I mean really

crashing into everything

so

yeah I can't

Judy good pumpkin thank you kitten

going to rest okay so
